The search suggestion drop-down frequently disappears while I'm typing a phrase, even if the phrase I'm typing matches the top suggestion exactly.

Let's say I'm searching for "search engines". Having typed "search e", the top suggestion is already "search engines". I notice this, and want to pick this suggestion.

However, due to a mental delay my fingers are still typing, so I end up adding "ng", making the whole phrase "search eng". Most of the time this will work just fine, and the drop-down will still be there after I typed "ng".

Occasionally though, the drop-down will disappear - and not reappear again regardless of how long I wait (unless I type more text).

This is rather frustrating to the user because the drop-down disappears at the exact moment the user is about to actually use it.

Reproducible: Sometimes




I suspect that every time I type something a web request gets made, and if the results don't arrive quickly enough the box is removed.

Suggestion: if the results don't arrive, and a drop-down had previously been shown, leave the (stale) drop-down open (and try to get the results again?), because it's less annoying.

The fact that the box is being refreshed could be indicated somehow - e.g. the "search" icon to the right of the search box could be animated.
