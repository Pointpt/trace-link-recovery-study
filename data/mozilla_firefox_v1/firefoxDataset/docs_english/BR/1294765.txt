First Comment Text: (1) I went to https://blog.monotonous.org/2016/03/07/narrate-a-new-feature-in-firefox-nightly/
(2) Put the page in reader mode
(3) Clicked on Narrate and hit play
(4) For voice I choose Carmit(Hebrew)

What I was expecting was someone to speak in Hebrew. Instead the voice is speaking English.
