First Comment Text: Occasionally, I'll open a new tab, type a letter (to get to some bookmark), and be greeted with zero awesomebar suggestions.  Pressing <down> doesn't give me suggestions.  Closing and re-opening the new tab doesn't fix things either.

The CPU isn't spinning while the awesomebar isn't listing suggestions.

But if I go off and do something else in the browser and come back a few minutes later, the awesomebar starts working again.

Sorry for the vague STR.  This has been happening to me for at least a few weeks.
