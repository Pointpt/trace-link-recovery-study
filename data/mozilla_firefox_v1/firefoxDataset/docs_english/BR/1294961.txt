Build ID: 20160623154057

Steps to reproduce:

1.1	Launch Firefox 49.0b3.
1.2	Open a page in Reader Mode. 
1.3	In the left toolbar, click the third icon from the top (the Narrate icon).
1.4	Try out all the available options: Play/Stop, Forward, Back


Actual results:

The BACK button does not function consistently. If the BACK button is pressed multiple times it usually restarts at the beginning of the current paragraph, but it periodically restarts at the beginning of the previous paragraph.


Expected results:

The BACK button should always restart at the beginning of the current paragraph.
