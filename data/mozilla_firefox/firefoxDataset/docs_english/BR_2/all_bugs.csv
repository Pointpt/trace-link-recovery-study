24278|The download window is not resizable!|x86|File Handling|2000-01-18T23:21:55Z|||I just tried to download a file with mozilla. Never mind that Shift+Click to download seems to be broken right now. I right clicked on the URL and choose download from the popup menu. Then I got a dialog that was far too small to display all the contents. That is ok, but when I tried to resize it, I found that the window does not update after a resize. The solution to this problem is to make the download window respond to a resize. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, nobody say anything about "lets just make it non resizable". I posted another bug report about this sort of problem in the prefs and it lead to a long flame about what mozilla "should" do. The result, all windows need to be resizable, period.  I was running on a Red Hat 6.0 Linux box when I ran into this problem. I build from the CVS today (Jan 18th).|2000-01-18T23:21:55Z
27493|Default open/save directory isn't smart|All|File Handling|2000-02-12T03:41:00Z|relnote-user no-eta||The choice of default directory, which the file selector points at initially  when opening or saving a file, could be a lot more intelligent.  Build: 2000021014, Win98  To reproduce: * Create a folder in `My Documents' called `test'. Create an HTML file in the   `test' folder called `blah.html'. * Start a fresh installation of Mozilla, and open a Navigator window. * Select File > Open File ...  What should happen: * The file selector defaults to the `My Documents' directory (see below).  What actually happens: * The file selector defaults to the `Seamonkey' directory (or whatever directory   Mozilla was installed in).  Continue ... * Use the file selector to open C:\My Documents\test\blah.html. * Select File > Open ... again. Observe that the file selector starts at the   `test' directory, as it should. * Exit the file selector, and quit Mozilla. * Restart Mozilla, using the same profile, and select File > Open ... again.  What should happen: * The file selector starts at the `test' directory, as before.  What actually happens: * The file selector starts at a different directory (either `Seamonkey' or   `My Documents', depending on whether the first problem above has been fixed).  Continue ... * Use the file selector to open C:\My Documents\test\blah.html. * Rename the `test' directory to something else. * Select File > Open File ... again.  What should happen: * Since the `test' directory no longer exists, the file selector reverts to its   first option, the `My Documents' directory.  What actually happens: * The file selector starts at the Desktop.  How to fix these bugs:  * Make the last-used directory persistent not only during a session, but between   sessions. This can be done by storing it in prefs.js.  * When an open/save dialog is about to be opened, open it in the following   directory, in order of preference (if one doesn't exist, fall back to the next   option):    - Windows     1. Directory of current file (if local)     2. Last-used directory     3. {System drive}:\My Documents\     4. Desktop    - MacOS     1. Directory of current file (if local)     2.

However, I like the functionality, the panels. E.g. I like to have headlines from various sources at one glance on request. Opening/closing the sidebar for this doesn't seem to be the optimal solution in all cases.  It would be cool to have pages similar to <http://my.netscape.com>, which I can open in the browser and to which I can add panels, but of course local and I shouldn't be limited to one of those pages.|2000-05-10T18:05:00Z

40106|Accelerated Download for files with mirrors (swarming)|All|File Handling|2000-05-22T07:56:18Z|multiple _different_ sites, not the same one multiple times. (See comment #26)||This is basically an extension of 22796 to add my ideas - but I believe it is different enough to include as a different bug and should be.   Basically, download accelerator somehow gets all mirrors of a server you are  downloading a file from and switches between servers as the file downloads  depending on the ping (I think). That way you get a superfast download (I once  got 800K on a 10Mb/s total LAN). I think Mozilla should have a default download  accelerator that comes with it which can be replaced, of course, if someone  downloads a replacement from some other company.   Also - you could show download status on the window along with a  clickable advertisement that changes every couple minutes. That way, you can  make money while people download - YEAH!!! - whaddayathink? Am I evil or what?  :)  That could be built on top of the 22796 - download before choosing file.|2000-05-22T07:56:18Z
40253|Execute the download of all links (like wget --recursive)|All|File Handling|2000-05-23T07:29:46Z|||I think the browser, on request, should be able to download all the pages in a  certain site while he/she goes and eats something, etc.   The question is... How will the browser know when the site ends and others  begin. I mean, if the browser wasn't given limits, it could download the WHOLE  WEB! Also, it might download a site more than once.  Obviously, a user would have to limit (A)number of pages downloaded (B)how many  levels of links to execute (C)the domains that are allowed or a combination of  the 3. Obviously, you would be able to stop it. It would also be able to recover  on messed up pages.  Pages predownloaded would be stored in a special cache dir and could be copied  to another part of the disk to save. All images, etc. would be downloaded with  the pages - therefore, you could copy a whole site to the hard disk with, of  course, certain restrictions. IE - you couldn't copy cgis.  Another idea I have is that someone can post a site map file to the site. The  browser could then open this file and download the pages by how the sitemap file  lists them. The user could even view the sitemap file and select which parts  he/she wants to download. The sitemap file would contain the data to construct a  tree. Each node could have a name, description, size info, and url.|2000-05-23T07:29:46Z

54940|must define list of default MIME type associations for Helper Apps Preferences|All|File Handling|2000-10-02T20:57:41Z|[adt3] se-radar||Using Commercial 2000093008 on WinNT 4.0 SP4.  To repro: 1) Edit-->Preferences 2) click "Helper Apps"  Only two default MIME-type-to-helper-app associations are listed (one for PDF to Adobe, the other for HTML which presumably starts a Navigator window).  Granted, we've never committed to have a default association of all known MIME types to all known plug-ins (or anything like this), but shouldn't there be more than two defaults registered here? Having only two listed seems suspiciously low.  How many defaults did we have registered in Nav4? Shouldn't some defaults be included for plug-ins bunded with Netscape 6 such as Flash? (maybe Flash is a bad example as it's a pure plug-in, not a helper app) If we register the PDF association by default, why not others such as RealPlayer? What are the criteria that determine which helper apps appear on this list?  Opening this bug for investigation to make sure that we're doing the right thing for RTM.|2000-10-02T20:57:41Z
57420|no support for helper app command line args|All|File Handling|2000-10-20T15:35:19Z|[proto]||(Using M18 on Linux (buildid 2000101805) but I would guess this is XP)  It is impossible to set a commandline argument to a helper application. For example, the linux mp3 player xmms takes a "-e" argument to "enqueue" the argument (add it to an already playing playlist) versus playing it immediately (replacing the current playlist). With Mozilla, it is impossible to configure xmms as a helper application with this flag enabled.  Steps to reproduce: Click on a link that returns an unknown content-type (eg audio/mpegurl) Attempt to enter "/usr/X11R6/bin/xmms -e" as the command  Expected results: Entering this is possible, and runs xmms with the arguments "-e" "tmpfilename"  Actual results: The text editing box is greyed out; it is only possible to browse to applications, so the "-e" cannot even be entered.    The same bug manifests itself in a different way in the preferences dialog:  Edit > Preferences > Helper Applications > New Set an appropriate description and extension, set the mimetype to audio/mpegurl, and the action to /usr/X11R6/bin/xmms -e Ok > Ok Click on a link with this mimetype Press Ok to open with "xmms -e"  Expected results: xmms is launched with the arguments "-e" "tmpfilename". Actual results: nothing apparently happens at all  Presumably Moz is actually looking for a file called "xmms -e" in the /usr/X11R6/bin directory and trying to run it - this is pure speculation, but makes sense.  A workaround is to create a script eg /home/$user/bin/xmms-e containing the following:  #!/bin/bash xmms -e "$@"  Then configure the helper application to be xmms-e.  This is 4xp because all 4.x versions supported arbitrary command lines for helper apps: You could enter anything you wanted and %s was replaced by the temporary filename. The lack of such support makes it impossible to configure mp3s and m3us to enqueue rather than play, for example, when clicked on.  (note: I'm submitting this as UNCONFIRMED because I've only tested on M18, not the latest nightlies)|2000-10-20T15:35:19Z
58554|Support using external programs to show non-inlined images and other content|All|File Handling|2000-10-31T07:25:59Z|||Build ID: current CVS build   Right now, if you ask Mozilla to show an image that is not inlined into other content, either via 'View Image' or via giving it the URL directly (such as a direct link to a JPEG) the image is always shown by Mozilla inside a browser window.   RFE: it should be possible to have Mozilla pass such images to an external application instead of showing it itself. The user may have applications that are better suited for the job than Mozilla itself; on various platforms there are image viewing programs that support, eg, better scrolling, image gamma manipulation, and so on.   This is a Netscape 4.x compatability feature on at least Unix: NS 4.x allows you to do this via the Preferences | Navigator | Applications dialog set.   This overriding should not stop Mozilla from displaying the images when they have been inlined in other content, eg as an IMG SRC in a HTML web page.   There is probably a better component for this than Browser General, but I have no idea what it should be. (I feel so embarassed.)|2000-10-31T07:25:59Z

59808|Change nsSpecialSystemDirectory::operator=(OS_TemporaryDirectory) to violate FHS|All|File Handling|2000-11-11T01:44:14Z|||(This is OS="generic Unix", but Bugzilla is missing that choice.)  Much of Mozilla uses a hardcoded path of /tmp for temporary files. As demonstrated in bug 58371 and exposed about weekly on bugtraq, this is not really a good thing. Temporary files generated by a user should be put in a user-specific directory where they can not interfere with other users' temporary files (or worse, get interfered with by other users).  Many applications use a TMPDIR environment variable. This is generic enough to warrant a library routine of some sort which is called for every temporary file. Ideally, that could do the following: - if $TMPDIR exists, use that - if $HOME/tmp exists, use that - else use $HOME/.mozilla/tmp (create that if not available) - ideally never fall back to /tmp  Really, /tmp is one of the worse ideas of Un*x. It is somewhat of a bigger project, but should be worth the effort, to remove its usage from Mozilla.|2000-11-11T01:44:15Z

The idea is to allow the execution of executable files that are stored locally. Since Mozilla already supports browsing of local filesystems via file:// urls and opening of various files using helpers, adding the ability to execute local binaries (scripts can already be done with helpers) would allow one to use Mozilla as a graphical shell / file manager.|2000-11-13T06:37:59Z

This button shall act like the "save as" in the right-click-menu.  This is needed because some servers are misconfigured and send the mimetype for instance "text/html" rather than "text/unknown" or something like that.

It will simply continue as if nothing happens and then it will truncate the file after the download has been completed.  It is duplicated easily by downloading a file that is too big to fit in you cache.

67178|"download file" option in Open Web Location dialog|All|File Handling|2001-01-31T15:34:50Z|||I sometimes need to download large HTML files using Mozilla, but don't have a  page with a link to the file I'm downloading.  I usually end up typing in  data:text/html,<a href="url">foo and then right-clicking the link :(  I'd like  to see a "download file" option added to the Open Web Location dialog.  Questions/potential problems:  - Should it be "download" or "save"?  "(download) target", "(download) url",  or "(download) file"?  - Currently the text next to the drop-down is "Open in:", so the whole thing  shows up as "Open in: [Current Navigator window]."  Can "download" be made to  fit with this text, should the text be changed, or should "Open in" be moved  inside the drop-down items that need it (so there would be no text outside)?  - Should there also be an "open" or "open with..." option?  If this is added,  we need to make sure that whatever security warnings are added to  the "downloading unknown mime type" dialog are also seen by people using this  option.  One possibility would be to just add one new option to Open Web  Location called "save/open" which would open a dialog similar to the "download  unknown mime tpye" dialog, but that might seem redundant.|2001-01-31T15:34:50Z
68515|Use Internet Config as base for Helper Apps pref UI|PowerPC|File Handling|2001-02-11T20:27:11Z|[se-radar]||Once bug 68514 and bug 68513 are fixed, we need some user interface to allow the  user to change these settings from within Mozilla.  This needs to be integrated with Internet Config such that when the user makes  changes in Mozilla, the system wide Internet Config settings are also changed,  otherwise the user will become extremely confused! :)   The basics of the UI should be to pick up the correct icon and descriptions from  internet config and display them.   However, since Internet Config only has the concepts of "Save to disk" and "Open  With Application" we would need to extend this to say "Handle internally in  browser" and "Handle With Plugin". This means Navigator must store 2 of the  possiibilities internally, then defer to Internet Config for the other two  possibilities. Perhaps not the easiest thing for the backend, but this is a bug  on what the UI should do.  See IE5 on Mac OS for an example.  Whether we want preferences for protocols (confusingly known as Helper Apps in  the Internet control panel) and for filename extensions and mime types (Moz's  idea of what a helper application is, known as "File Mapping" in the internet  control panel) I don't know. 2 seperate preference panels might be too confuding|2001-02-11T20:27:11Z
71656|Create preview icons for downloaded images|PowerPC|File Handling|2001-03-12T04:47:51Z|[p-ie/mac]||At least Macs, and I believe Windows of the 98/2000 or newer vintage support  preview icons for images. Actually some Mac image formats have explicit support  for a preview image, *and* a preview icon ... i.e. the icon used for the image on  disk is a mini version of the image.  Since I implemented support for creating Mac icons, this should be relatively  easy, once that's checked in. Will set depends.  One issue: its really really inefficient for tiny images. This means we might  want a pref... but prefs for esosteric things are evil. So maybe a pref with no  user interface.|2001-03-12T04:47:51Z

When I was a proxy administrator, I hated working with a configuration file that I could not easily see. Knowing that the browser can load and display the file is a win for admins (ease of configuration) and users (they can see where their requests are going).  NOTES: The download dialog also was behaving weird in several ways. I used Mac, but will update for Win32+Linux later:  1- Open does not display the file, but saves it to disk as a text file (openable in Simpletext) 2- Save suggests a filename, but already creates the file on disk, so you cannot save to the suggested name. If you change the name so you can save, you get a corrupted file that has a blank file icon but appears to ResEdit as a folder?!|2001-05-01T23:38:22Z

New proposal: shift+click (or maybe alt+click) should display the dialog where the action is chosen for the downloaded file.  The dialog should have the following actions (some already exist):   - Use default action    [ action displayed here ]        (Set Default...)  - Open in navigator  - Open in new navigator window  - Save to disk      [default download directory+filename|] (Browse...)  - Open with application     [] (Choose...)  - Open with plugin    [] (Choose...)  Save to disk would be the default.  Default download directory should be set in prefs. The idea is to avoid the "Save As" dialog in most cases if a reasonable filename is already provided by the server.  Basically, what is needes is more flexibility handling various content types.|2001-05-30T11:49:17Z

102277|"Saving File" keep-open checkbox shouldn't work with helper-apps|All|File Handling|2001-09-28T22:55:28Z|||The "Saving File" window has a checkbox that says "Keep this window open after the download is complete".  Presumably, this was meant as a helpful reminder so you don't forget about something you left downloading.  However, this feature becomes a pain because the check-box is persistent; checking it once affects all future dialogs (until you un-check it).  Still no problem until you realize it affects file downloads that are to be run by helper-apps.  So even though I like the "keep-open" feature, I don't use it because it's too much of a pain in the ass dismissing the windows that get left open for every MP3 file I play from Mozilla.  This is with 0.9.4.  Not sure if this is a bug or enhancement, but possible solutions include: 1. Make the check-box default to off, and make it non-persistent.  Every time a user wants the window to hang around as a reminder, they have to check the box during the download. 2. (preferred) Bypass the "keep-open" setting when the download is going to launch a helper app.|2001-09-28T22:55:28Z

103724|viewing html files created with wincommander's  "pack and execute"|x86|File Handling|2001-10-08T21:06:45Z|||This is not exactly a bug in mozilla. Maybe it is a bug in wincommander, or a feature mozilla lacks.  wincommander is a popular file manager for win32 (can be downloaded from, e.g., TUCOWS). I'm currently using wincommander 4.53, but I believe that this should apply to any other version.  wincommander has transparent handling of archives (e.g: zip archives). Whenever it needs to handle files from the archive it extracts them under c:\windows\temp\$WC\ When it is requered to "open" a file, it presents a dialog to as if the user wants wincommander to "unpack and execute" the file. If yes: it extracts the file under the $WC directory , runs the program to handle it, waits for it to exit, and deletes the file.  When explorer is the handler of html files, the fiels remains in $WC long enough for it to run. However when mozillais the handler of html files, the file is deleted before mozilla gets to read it, and thus mozilla presents an empty document (and not an error message! but that's a seperate bug).  Any idea how to cause wincommander to delete this document only after mozilla reads it? Is this relevant to other programs as well?  I've placed this bug under "QuickLaunch" because I couldn't think of a better alternative. Actually it still happens if I disable QuickLaunch (and totally exit mozilla)  Steps to reproduce on a win32 system:  1. make sure WinCommander is installed (evaluation copy can be downloaded from TUCOWS) 2. make sure mozilla is associated with *.html 3. create a zip archive that contains an html file 4. run wincommander5. press Enter on the arcive to open it 6. in it, press Enter on the file to open it  expected result:  the document shoud be displayed  Actual result:  A blank document is displayed.|2001-10-08T21:06:45Z

Now, whenever I receice attachments from clients, it would be very useful to be able to quickly select that project's directory and save the files there.

116951|save dialog does not give the user choice of viewing filetypes he/she wishes|All|File Handling|2001-12-26T22:28:15Z|||Save dialog gives you all the choice to view filetypes it *believes* you want to see.  For example.  I download a XUL file, which the webserver reported as plain/text.  The save dialog refused to give me the choice of *.xul in the directory, but instead only gave *.txt and *.text in the "files of type" dropdown menu.    This I believe is incorrect.  The user should be given the choice of "most popular filters" including a "all types *.*" filter.  Downloading a .gz file does not mean one only want's to see *.gz files in the directory.  In addition to always providing a "all types *.*" type, I believe the dropdown list should be a edit/dropdown list, just as the location bar.  Giving the user to enter the filter of their choice. eg. "*.xul" for a plain/text file.|2001-12-26T22:28:15Z

I've found when it saves my personal web page (http://turbogeek.org), it wraps certain long lines, sometimes inconsistently. For example, the first paragraph, which starts "Hello, and welcome", wraps first in column 407. For the rest of the <p>, it word-wraps before column 80, except for the last line, which extends about 140 columns.  It shouldn't do any wrapping at all, as it is one long line in the original. But it DEFINATELY shouldn't be doing screwy, inconsistent wrapping like that.  The <li>'s are also wrapped similarly... sometimes just before column 80, and sometimes at random high spots.|2002-01-04T23:52:11Z

There are a few issues in the way   nsOSHelperAppService::GetFileTokenForPath in  uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsOSHelperAppService.cpp handles PATH  searching. In no particular order,  1) PR_GetEnv("PATH") should be tested for null. There's no guarantee  PATH exists for the process. It's an interesting question what to do in  this case.  2) While the code tests for an absolute path ("/") it doesn't test for  "./" or ../". There is a big difference between executing "./foo" and  "foo". While this would almost certainly be some sort of user error,  executing some other random program is certainly not a good thing. I  think that fixing this would mean using nsLocalFile::Normalize but it's  at least partially broken now on unix (bug 110769).  3) I am not sure but I don't think the code correctly implements the Linux PATH semantics. A PATH of ":/bin::/usr/bin:" is treated as ".:/bin:.:/usr/bin:.". Note that this brings us back to ./foo and Normalize. The really big issue is whether these rules apply to any other unix system. The correct solution would be to use the platform  execvp but that may be quite hard to do.  In the absence of a execvp wrapper I would think the only safe approach  would be to invoke the user's shell to find and run the program.|2002-02-14T16:24:16Z

126530|Reloading resources handled by external applications|All|File Handling|2002-02-20T02:18:32Z|||If a URL points to a resource whose content type is handled by an external application (not Mozilla or a plugin), then there is no way to request a refresh. For instance, if http://foo.com/news.doc has changed but is already cached, you cannot ask Mozilla to retrieve the current version.  Even clearing the memory and disk cache may not help, since the old version may be cached in intermediate proxies and normal HTTP retrieval, unlike a refresh, does not issue a "Cache-Control: max-age=0" header.  Some possible solutions:  1. Add an "Open Refreshed" item to the context menu of links. Its action would be similar to a click, except it would force a refresh. Note that this makes sense for HTML resources too. However, it does not help when you enter the URL manually rather than follow a link.  2. Make Alt-click have a similar effect.  3. Drag&drop a link onto the refresh button, or vice versa.     (Highly nonstandard.)  4. Currently, when you attempt to open an externally handled resource, the external application is activated but the logical "current URL" of the Mozilla windows where you were working is unchanged. This makes sense when you follow a link, but in two other cases it's reasonable to change the behavior: when the URL is entered manually (e.g., using the URL bar) and when you use "Open in New Window" or "Open in New Tab". In these cases Mozilla can record the new URL, and then the Refresh button would refresh and reload the external resource. Alas, this would usually mean that you need to first load the old version and close it, and then load the new version.  BuildID:    2002020406|2002-02-20T02:18:32Z

137339|want way to hand URL to helper apps without downloading whole document first (for streaming)|All|File Handling|2002-04-14T01:18:32Z|||Consider an HTTP page that links to some mp3 files.  If I click on a link, Mozilla downloads the whole mp3 file to a temp file, and several minutes later, it invokes "xmms /tmp/XXXX", and I hear audio.  If, instead of downloading the data, it would have just invoked "xmms http://...XXX.mp3", then I would have heard audio immediately, because xmms can play streams.  I can get this behavior by launching xmms by hand, and then dragging and dropping the URL links onto the xmms window; but that assumes that I have xmms running already, which I might not.  I'm not sure what the best way to do this is, since you still need to contact the server to find the content-type -- perhaps you could start downloading the URL, and then once you know the content type, and see that you're supposed to just pass the URL to an external program, abort the download and let the external program start over?  Way way back, we used to have a .mailcap extension that would let Netscape start external programs as a pipe, and stream the data to them on stdin -- I don't know if that's still supported, but even if it is, it doesn't help much, because xmms can't  read from stdin.  It wants either a filename or a URL.  Web sites can side-step this problem by using .M3U or .PLS files, which are small documents that just contain indirect links to the real URLs -- Mozilla downloads the M3U, hands that to xmms, and xmms opens the HTTP URL that is inside -- but there are a lot of web sites out in the world that do not do it this way (e.g., if it's just a directory listing of files.)|2002-04-14T01:18:32Z

There are several bugs on file-extensions, but I didn't find one for this.  When saving a file using the 'Save As' dialog, mozilla adds an extension even when setting another extension, and setting the 'Save as type' to the 'All  Files' filter.  Steps to reproduce: 1) Go to ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/latest/ 2) Click on 'embed-win32.zip'. In the downloading dialog choose 'Save this  file to disk' 3) In the Save As dialog change 'Save as type' to 'All Files' 4) Change the filename/ set a new extension for example: 'embed-win32.zp3 5) Press on 'Save'  Expected result: The file is saved as 'embed-win32.zp3' Actual result: The file is saved as 'embed-win32.zp3.zip' - Mozilla should not try to add  the extension when there already is an  extension in the filename. - Mozilla should not add an extension when the 'All Files' filtertype is  selected.  Even beter demonstration: ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/latest/mozilla-source.tar.bz2 tries  to save to mozilla-source.tar.bz2.exe even when trying to remove .exe When downloading an iso file like:  ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/7.2/en/iso/i386/enigma-i386-disc1.iso Mozilla adds '.exe' to the filename so saving as 'enigma-i386-disc1.iso.exe'|2002-05-03T19:45:11Z

I see three separate bugs here:    A: there is NO WAY mozilla should be writing the file name from the      web server to my disk!  It should be using randomized names, as it      did in 4.x.  What if I had a file called "128.m3u" in my /tmp dir      already that I was not yet ready to delete?  What if the file name      from the server was long, or contained inappropriate characters?       These files should be named the same way files in .mozilla/*/Cache/      are named: as hashes or something.    B: after the helper app has exited, the file should have been deleted,      instead of being left around taking up space and cluttering my /tmp      directory.       In 3.x and 4.x, the temp file was not deleted for a few seconds after      the helper app exited, because some programs auto-fork: e.g., if      xmms is already running, then "xmms /tmp/128.m3u" will simply send a      message to the running xmms, and exit immediately.  Sometimes you need      to give it a few seconds for that other process to wake up, lest it try      to read from a file that you just deleted.

157422|Saving Multiple Tabs as Single File|All|File Handling|2002-07-14T17:05:28Z|||Since using tabs I've noticed that I've changed my browsing methods. Now, when I'm researching an issue (technical, political, scientific, sociological, etc.) I now use the tab feature to pull in related articles within the same window of the initial one. This allow me to accumulate many POVs on a particular subject. In many cases, I've wanted to save this "grouped" data for later review or even future reference.  Mozilla does allow one to do this in an online fashion, using the group bookmark method but this often isn't sufficient since it merely saves the bookmarks which will then need to later be re-loaded from the net. This presents a couple of problems. One, there is no guarantee that all of the current articles will be available the next time one opens the group-bookmarks and, two, providing this information externally to, say, another person in the forms of multiple bookmarks makes it less likely that they will review the entire group of articles.  What's needed is a means to save a tabbed window as a single, self-extracting archive file. There are a number of formats that support this, the most well-known being the zip format.  As to the save structure, Mozilla should add a link to each saved page that points to the originating page, perhaps at the bottom, so that one could easily go back to the information source to both verify the content and also determine if the content has been updated since the archive had been created.  Also, Mozilla should create a TOC page that contains the links to the local version of the tabbed pages. When the files is expanded, this would be the page that is loaded, by default. However, Mozilla should set a flag in this TOC's HTML (perhaps a special attribute in the generated DOCTYPE, or some other, tag?) that would be ignored by other non-tabbed browsers but would signify to Mozilla to open the other pages in the file as tabs. (This may not be needed since Mozilla will know the file contains multiple pages and default to "tabbing" them?)  My belief is that this feature would extend the usefullness of tabbed browsing in a way that is consistent (and unique) with the intent of the tab design interface and be viewed very positively from the general user community at large.|2002-07-14T17:05:28Z

For example, on windows (where I've observed this, not sure if it's the same at home on linux) I might save the file in C:/MyDocuments or C:/temp, but launch apps from C:/ProgramFiles/.../ On unix I might save in /tmp or ~/tmp and launch from /usr/bin/ - but *certainly* wouldn't be saving anything to /usr/bin - or running apps from /tmp (apologies if it doesn't act like this on unix.) The current scenario means I have to traverse several directories to find the app to launch, then next time I save a file i must traverse the dirs again to my downloads folder, then back again next time I want to launch an app, and back again etc etc. The last used dir is great if you save several files to one place, or launch several files in the same app, but mixing the two actions is incredibly annoying. I'd prefer it if there was one "last used" directory for saving and a separate one for launching apps. I'm using 1.1b on win98|2002-08-05T13:03:31Z

There are dozens of bug reports for this, usually marked Evangelism or Invalid.  3: Some Linux users want Mozilla to navigate through archives transparently as if they were directories. See bug 64286 for example.  I submit this enhancement request mainly on behalf of faction 2.

Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 0. From bug 201108 comment 4: 1. Do step 1 and 2 2. If you see "vide_g.html" in the left frame, do step 3 and 4 also. (that's bug 201108)  3. On the left frame (you should see "frame2_g.html" now): 4. Use "This Frame > Save Frame As...": the default filename is "frame2_g.html" :-) 5.

Expected Results:   For consistency, the "disk" filemane of that frame should reflect its current "memory" filename, as in "Save Frame As...".

Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 0. From bug 201108 comment 4: 1. Do step 1 and 2 2. If you see "vide_g.html" in the left frame, do step 3 and 4 also. (that's bug 201108)  3. On the left frame (you should see "frame2_g.html" now): 4. Use "This Frame > Save Frame As...": the default filename is "frame2_g.html" :-) 5. Use "Save Page As..." with "(Web Page, complete)" option  Actual Results:   The current content ("frame2_g.html") of the left frame was saved under the name ("vide_g.html"; probably taken from the source of the frameset !?) of the initial frame.   Expected Results:   For consistency, the "disk" filemane of that frame should reflect its current "memory" filename, as in "Save Frame As...".  Obviously, the frameset content should be saved/updated accordingly.   Workaround: do the job manually afterward; not so easy, especially if there are many frames, or if one does not notice the issue.

Note that the dialog says "Open with default application (Word)". make sure that is selected, click OK.  ACTUAL RESULTS: watch Winzip open with the file.  EXPECTED RESULTS: Word should open the file.  ANALYSIS: 1. we lookup the mimeinfo from the os, and get one for application/msword as expected 2. we look in prefs and find no mimeinfo by type 3. we look in prefs and do find a mimeinfo by extension (gz) 4. the final mimeinfo we have has this properties: Type        application/msword Extensions  gz doc  Default application description: Word   NOTES SO FAR: o) primary extension is gz! this is because we got gz as an extension from     prefs, and we set it as primary one in DoContent because it matched the url's    extension) o) On windows, mozilla does not explicitly store the default application here,     only its description!  END RESULT: nsExternalAppHandler decides that the file (word.php.gz) already matches the primary extension of the mimeinfo (gz, see note 1), and does not append any further extension.  In the end, it ShellExecutes the file with the original filename (word.php.gz), opening the default application for .gz files.|2004-01-02T00:57:53Z

230449|Make helper app progress dialog more customizeable|x86|File Handling|2004-01-08T23:10:45Z|||The progress dialog invoked by the helper app service today is very browser centric. Some of the features in it don't make much sense when you are opening mail attachments in seamonkey.   For instance, there is no notion of pausing/resuming saving of attachments for an imap connection. So this button really should not be visible.  I'm filing this bug to look into supporting flags for controlling UI elements in the progress dialog such as the presence of the Pause/Resume button. The question is who has the ability to set such a flag? We could cheat in the exthandler and have it look at the url scheme. Maybe a set of prefs which list which protocols support pause and resume.  Or we could figure out a way for the mailnews code which opens the url to pass in a flag for the current load which could later be checked by the progress dialog.   I'd also like to eventually change the fact that we show a convoluted, private imap/mailbox url in the "opening from" portion of the dialog, instead showing a more friendly mail string such as the name of the account. But I suspect that will be harder.   cc'ing the heavy hitters for exthandler\uriloader stuff|2004-01-08T23:10:45Z

Eg I have 'fred.html' open in tab1 and 'index.htm' open in tab2. Sometimes the only page that is saved is index.htm. However if I set breakpoints in the trigger and the callback (for the save) then it works correctly (using JS debugger/venkman). Depending where the code is paused and where breakpoints are set, I've even seen the first page saved but with the name of the second page.  It seems the callback (that does the writing) isn't 'reentrant' or there is a race condition. Another way of looking at this: "Save as web page complete" is fine, but not if you call it programatically, i.e for one page then the next, it appears that if no time is given in between saving the first & second pages, then the second page clobbers the first. This is unpredictable. I am working in mozilla\xpfe\communicator\resources\content\contentAreaUtils.js.   Reproducible: Sometimes Steps to Reproduce: Programatically save two web pages (two tabs).

239232|Image Manager UI|All|Preferences|2004-03-31T02:03:14Z|[myk-ucwe]||The current state of the image blocking UI isn't the best.  Currently, if "Block Images for <sitename>" is checked and you click that option, instead of removing the site permission, it actually sets the "Always Allow" permission.  This is something that's partially fixed in Seamonkey, but not quite yet.  There is also no comparable UI to the Cookies Exceptions window.  Basic UI Thoughts:  Context Menus: Keep the existing menu options if image loading is enabled (default) Fix the case mentioned above to remove the permission, not set it to white.  If images are disabled by default, change the context menu item to be "Allow Images from <sitename>" with the same checkmark style, removing (not reversing) the permission on second click.  This would allow people who have images off by default to enable certain site's graphics as desired.  It also makes more sense than a Block Images context menu item that has no apparent effect if disabled.  Image Manager: Enable direct entry of sites along the same lines as the Cookie Exceptions window.  Overall, the UI should be identical to the Cookie Exceptions window.  Alternatively, we could just hide all support for whitelisting and disable the contextmenu item with images disabled.  I think for the price of a single context menu item that we already have in the defeault setting, we can enable a potentially powerful feature that carries no bloat since its just utilizing an existing interface.|2004-03-31T02:03:14Z

The situation under discussion is:     The user chooses to open with Application A (which is default, so far) and    decides that mozilla shouldn't ask any more (User trusts Application A so why    should mozilla ask again...). Some days later the user installs Application B    which "steals" the default status for $FILETYPE. Now Mozilla automatically    opens this filetype with the new application and the user hasn't got asked...  I feel that the right approach to this is to store not just the fact that we want to use the default app but also a checksum for the info identifying the default app (this checksum would be generated by the OSHelperAppService).  If the checksum we have stored and the checksum for whatever the OS returns don't match, ignore the "don't ask" flag and ask anyway.  Though use different text, like "You have selected to use the default application for type X, but this has changed.

It doesn't explain squat: - what a "protocol" is (or at least which kind of "protocol" exactly) - what the user should do to prevent this "deadlock" situation - detailed steps how the user is supposed to resolve this problem - it's very non-informative in general  If Mozilla intends to attract a large share of users, then this and possibly similarly broken parts should be fixed ASAP.  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Enter in URL bar: "mailto:someone@somewhere.com" 2. Hit Return Actual Results:   Alert "mailto is not a registered protocol" message box  Expected Results:   Soemthing like:  Alert "'mailto' is an internet protocol which Firefox/Mozilla/... doesn't recognize, because it doesn't know of any helper program which can understand this protocol. Please [...]"  [...] could be something like (in preferred order): a) go to http://XXX.mozilla.org for detailed help on this issue. b) do an Internet search for helper programs able to understand protocol XXXX c) go to Preferences (some page to set this up) to do XXX  This could be improved by adding more detailed information for unregistered protocols that Firefox knows about, such as mailto: (--> Thunderbird). Even providing a direct download link for possible protocol handlers would be conceivable (the best solution, perhaps??).  Such additional code will bloat the browser, though, so directing the user to a web page is probably preferred.  Assigning "major" to it, since such an unfinished raw error message may often leave a VERY bad taste for hesitating new IE converts.

Previously, the HEAD response was used (if possible) to determine the suggested target filename (when saving a url).  However now, when the target is an http address such as the root note of a website (and not specifically an html page, file or otherwise), there is a problem. Without a known content type or document object, the browser can only /guess/ a sensible name for the target filename. For example, if the target URL is http://www.xyz.com, the target filename would be given the name "http_www.xyz.com_", which will be wrong in basically all cases. Therefore with patch 160223, the extension ".htm" is added to the suggested filename IF, at the end of the method that determines the filename, the following is true: a) a file extension has not yet been determined, b) the url starts with "http://", c) the content type is unknown, and d) there is no document object.  NB (c) and (d) are true when performing a 'save link target'.  This should cause no problem when linking to a website (apparently not specifically to a particular file) where the protocol is http, as it would be most common for the webserver to present an html file as the default file.  While this default action (adding the ".htm" extension) should cause no problem in the majority of cases, can we come up with a better heuristic?   Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce Steps to Reproduce: Somebody should be able to confirm if there's a problem by making the default page served up by a web site something other than an html file.

The use cases are:   1. the user actually wanted to close the window 2. the user meant to close just the front tab  ... plus of course the "oops" case. In my personal experience, use case 2 is the most common (i.e., I make this mistake frequently). However, if I did mean to close the current tab, the required sequence of steps to accomplish this goal, after the dialogue box appears, is:  1. select [Cancel] in the dialogue 2. close the front tab using one of the other available mechanisms.  I believe there is a clean interface that can do better; see "expected results" below.   Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. In | Tools | Options | Advanced | Browsing |, ensure "Warn when closing multiple tabs" is selected. 2. Have multiple tabs open in a browser window. 3. Click the window close control.

I've removed extensions when this happens, or when I've had a hunch an extension was badly behaved, and Firefox is a lot more stable, but it still happens occasionally.  What I want is a mechanism to track how much time Firefox is spending in different extensions, so I can find out which, if any, if my remaining extensions need to be ripped out.  Just having a file that it dumps when it enters and exits an extension and how much CPU time it took that I could grovel through afterwards would be great.

As a result, when the local copy is displayed, things represented by entities, like the copyright, trademark, and registered symbols, are shown as triples of nonsense characters instead of the appropriate glyphs. Proper behavior would be instead to save the document with the #whatever; entities in their original format.  Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open indicated URL 2. Do a "File => Save page as..." 3. Choose Save as type: Web Page Complete 4. Open local copy in another tab 5. Do "View => Page Source" on original page and on local copy 6. See HTML entities in body source of original, see rendered    unicode trigraphs in body source of saved copy  Actual Results:   Entities for copyright, trademark, and registered symbols were replaced by the ASCII characters of the Unicode trigraphs in the source HTML of the saved local copy, resulting in munged special symbols in the rendered version of the local copy.  Expected Results:   The "File => Save page as..." functionality should have downloaded and saved a clean, unrendered copy of the original HTML source, or if one still existed, saved a locally cached unrendered version of the HTML source.  A bugzilla search on "unicode entities" shows many bugs that may be symptoms of the same base design failure as this one, but none seemed to capture the "mis-saving" aspect of the problem.  I've marked this bug as "major", since the page saving feature is broken in a way that makes saving a working local copy of a page containing HTML entities impossible, but other thinking might classify it as "critical", since data is lost/damaged during the save process.  Comment: The bugzilla page on which this is entered asks the user to select "component". This is a bad idea, since there is in general no way a user not familiar with the code can make an intelligent choice there. The breakdown needs to be change to a breakdown by functionality/widget accessed/menu item selected, since the user certainly knows that the "Save page as" functionality is what is broken.  Also, the use there of the acronym "DOM" and similarly opaque namings is user hostile for the user who is not a Mozilla developer. I don't know where or how to file this as a bug, or against what, since it is a meta issue not about the browser, but I'm hoping some developer will accept the initiative to do that bug filing for me, based on this comment text.|2004-11-22T16:43:17Z

There's also a request (bug 155830) for an error when the actual type of an image doesn't match the MIME type it's sent with.  This bug is a request for a similar message sent to the JavaScript console when a file is sent as text/plain, and it's sniffed as a binary file and the MIME type is inferred from its contents. This message will help alert web developers to errors in their server configuration or server scripts.

277580|accidentally pressed keys lead to dataloss when posting on forums|x86|Keyboard Navigation|2005-01-08T22:02:22Z|||Keyboard shortcuts may be nice for browsing (if anybody uses them?), but I would like to call attention to their awfully dangerous side effects when writing on online forums. It causes much frustration when one writes up long, pondering, well-written paragraphs, just to have them obliterated when one accidentally presses Ctrl+R (reloading the page), or inadvertently moves focus out of the edit window and then presses Backspace (going back to the previous page, often resetting input). These two key shortcuts alone have already caused me hours of lost work, and I virtually never use them for what they are actually intended.  I suggest that the grief caused by accidentally pressed keyboard shorcuts to bloggers and forum users is unacceptable and not in line with modern standards of software usability. The undoable and irrevocable loss of data that it leads to is more reminiscent of computers in the year 1990 than 2005. A solution should be found to alleviate this condition - the solution could be quite sophisticated or rather crude, but what matters is that there is some solution.

Which means we'll reopen the file on each ODA, with MakeOutputStreamFromFile, which passes default flags, which mean PR_TRUNCATE.  So the upshot is that for any channel that has a content-length of -1 (some HTTP responses, say, or IMAP channels), it looks like we'll only write the data in the last ODA to the file...  Even if that is not the case (though I fail to see how), asserting on a normal condition like "unknown content length" is just wrong.|2005-01-11T06:17:22Z

289615|bookmark dataloss in abnormal windows shutdown, especially FAT32 systems|x86|File Handling|2005-04-08T20:47:19Z|[at risk for 1.5]||I've been trying to reproduce the bookmark and other dataloss problems on Windows (both winXP and Win2K on NTFS) with no success for quite a while (bug 193749). After setting up a Win2K environment with FAT32 I can reliably reproduce a variety of dataloss bugs during abnormal windows shutdowns (hard reboots).   I haven't figured out exactly what causes the specific dataloss issues, but I can lose bookmarks, other profile data like cookies, or the full profile. Bookmarks and the full profile lossage seems easiest to reproduce.   Steps to reproduce: 1. Set up a Windows install on FAT32 2. Install Firefox (I've tested 1.0 and 1.0.2 and both are affected) 3. Open Firefox and do various browsing activities.  4. Either with Firefox running or shortly after Firefox shutdown, power down the machine. 5. Restart the machine and allow windows to perform the checkdisk function.  Results: a. open \Application Data\Mozilla and see it's empty - launching Firefox will offer the Migration wizard. This seems to happen if you power down Windows sometime soon after your initial Firefox install, but not limited to first Firefox run. b. open the \Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox directory and see nothing but these files: pluginreg.dat, Profiles (not a folder, a file,) and profiles.ini (and registry.dat in the parent dir.) The user will either get a Profile Wizard that claims the default profile is in use, or a new profile will be created. In some cases the user will get a "Profile couldn't be created. Probably the chosen folder isn't writable." dialog. c. open profile folder and see that bookmarks.html is gone but bookmarks.bak is fine. User experiences no problem. d. open profile and find that bookmarks.html and bookmarks.bak are both gone (I've also seen prefs.js and localstore disappear.) User starts up with an empty bookmarks folder and personal toolbar.  Expected Results: We should find and use, if possible, some Windows API to flush the FAT32 cache on browser exit, perhaps more regularly like say every 5 minutes.  Please do not dupe this bug against any other bugs, especially bug 193749. If and when we come up with a solution to the the lameness of FAT32 here, then we can see what's left at 193749 and create new bugs for those specific issues.|2005-04-08T20:47:19Z

Unfortunately, copy/cut/paste within the designMode="on" iframe ignores the iframe's "base href" and uses the iframe's document location instead. The result is that the image and link addresses in the cut/copied/pasted content are changed/corrupted.  Importance: This is a major problem for Mozilla's/Firefox's use in web content management systems etc. with Midas/designMode-based web content editors. Users risk breaking the edited content (unless they manually repair the corrupted image/link addresses after using copy/cut/paste - a cumbersome and error prone process).  Reproducible: every time (including testing a number of different Midas/designMode-based web content editor products from different vendors).   Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: Test case files: /image1.png /image2.png /test/image3.png /test/editor/image4.png /test/editor/test.html /test/editor/test.iframe.html  1) Open the "http://editor.hardcoreinternet.co.uk/test/editor/test.html" web page in the web browser. Four images are display correctly in the editable "content" iframe. The image and link addresses are correctly resolved relative to the iframe's "base href" as they should be.  2) Select the "View HTML" button to view the HTML code from the "content" iframe. The HTML code is: <a href="image1.png"><img src="image1.png"></a> <a href="/image2.png"><img src="/image2.png"></a> <a href="/test/image3.png"><img src="/test/image3.png"></a> <a href="/test/editor/image4.png"><img src="/test/editor/image4.png"></a>  3) Focus the "content" iframe with the four images and select all the content (i.e. using CTRL+A).  4) Copy or cut all the content (i.e. using CTRL+C or CTRL+X)  5) Paste the content back into the "content" iframe (i.e. using CTRL+V) Only two of the four images are now displayed and the two other images are "broken".  6) Select the "View HTML" button to view the HTML code from the "content" iframe.  Actual Results:   The HTML code is now: <a href="../../image1.png"><img src="../../image1.png"></a> <a href="../../image2.png"><img src="../../image2.png"></a> <a href="../image3.png"><img src="../image3.png"></a> <a href="image4.png"><img src="image4.png"></a>  The "a href" and "img src" addresses have been changed to be relative to the iframe's document location instead of being relative to the iframe's "base href". All eight image/link addresses are wrong (although two of the images are still displayed). The web browser still tries to resolve the image and link addresses relative to the iframe's "base href" as they should be, but the image and link addresses in the content are now relative to the iframe's document location.   Expected Results:   Solution: Copy/cut/paste should not modify the image and link addresses.  The HTML code should still be: <a href="image1.png"><img src="image1.png"></a> <a href="/image2.png"><img src="/image2.png"></a> <a href="/test/image3.png"><img src="/test/image3.png"></a> <a href="/test/editor/image4.png"><img src="/test/editor/image4.png"></a>|2005-05-18T17:32:15Z

In other words, I would like to be able to specify a "converter" or "filter" for MIME types instead of a "handler". A converter would (obviously) be something that could convert a file selected for display, generally of a format not supported directly by Firefox, to one of the formats that can be displayed inline - typically HTML. When encountering a file of a type linked to a "converter" rather than a "handler", Firefox would execute the command much like it will for a "handler", but also read its standard output and display it in the browser window.  This functionality might also be extended to special protocols, thus resolving the issue described in bug 217212.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce:|2005-06-01T14:04:17Z

Try to change the color for visited links to the default color of unvisited links.  There is one blue that looks similar, but it is actually different. 3. With some lower quality monitors, the two blues look the same.  If all the links look the same in the screenshot (see attached URL), then you can confirm that this bug exists by going to about:config and comparing the values for browser.anchor_color with browser.visited_color.  If the colours are actually the same, then the values should also be the same. Actual Results:   I could not change the visited link color so that it is the same as the unvisited link color.  The closest colour on the palette is visibly lighter.  Expected Results:   All the default colors should be on the palette.  This would allow users to revert to the defaults without going to about:config, as well as allowing users to set the visited link color to be the same as the unvisited link color.  This can all be done in about:config, but that's annoying and shouldn't happen.  The colour that is not on the palette is #0000EE.  The colour that is somewhat close to the default unvisited link color is #3333FF.  The screenshot shows the two different colors.|2005-06-22T21:38:40Z

298539|Memory dump of Firefox reveals sensitive information, including authentication credentials|x86|Security|2005-06-23T03:14:06Z|||User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.8) Gecko/20050511 Firefox/1.0.4  Mozilla Firefox stores sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords, in clear text in memory. By performing a memory dump of firefox.exe, it is possible to gather the sensitive information.  This vulnerability would be most likely exploited in the following situations:  1. An environment in which multiple people share a Windows XP computer with "Fast User Switching" enabled.  Example: User "A" logs into Windows, and starts firefox. He then logs into a website. Later, leaving Firefox running, he clicks on "Start", "Log Off", then "Switch User".  User "B" logs into Windows, and opens Task Manager. He locates the Process ID (PID) associated with users "A" firefox.exe. By running PMDump(1), user "B" can dump the memory of users "A" firefox.exe to a file. He can then open the file in a text editor (such as WordPad), and would be able to locate the authentication credentials that user A used to sign into the website.  2. An environment in which multiple people connect to a PC running Terminal Services/Remote Desktop Connection, in which Mozilla Firefox is installed. The process of gathering the sensitive data would be the same way used in the above Example 1; by using PMDump(1).  (1) http://ntsecurity.nu/toolbox/pmdump/  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: The steps to reproduce are described in the "Details" section of this bug report.  Actual Results:   I was able to retrieve authentication credentials from the memory dump of Firefox.  Expected Results:   The software should encode/encrypt/disguise sensitive data (such as usernames and passwords used in HTTP authentication).

300002|UI for logging out of sites using HTTP authentication/phishing attack preventer|All|Menus|2005-07-07T20:55:08Z|||Bug 55181 gave the ability to log out of all sites using HTTP authentication, Bug 260839 (in Core: Networking) is about making it possible for just one site, this bug is about having a good UI for doing so.  I described at http://dolphinling.net/firefox/httpauthui what I think is a good UI for logging out of websites using HTTP authentication. I've gotten a few positive comments on it, so I'm hoping it can get into Firefox.  A short description (a more detailed one is in the link above):   When someone logs into a website using HTTP auth, the username is displayed in the right side of the address bar, in some visually distinct way (like having a box around it). When this box is clicked (or right clicked, or tabbed to + enter for accessibility) a menu is displayed, with an option to log out.   This is intuitive and discoverable but not intrusive, and hopefully therefore good UI.   It also has the added benefit that it can help prevent phishing attacks of the form http://www.somebank.com@evilphishingsite.net/, since www.somebank.com is moved away and all that's displayed in the normal location for URLs is http://evilphishingsite.net/.  P.S. Please no comments about 300000th bug. It's a legitimate bug and discussion should be on topic.

In particular, it is possible to see the file names and sizes of files viewed from web pages or opened from e-mail attachments.  This information is typically hidden from other users, because browser history and e-mail content is not accessible from other accounts.  Although this bug is illustrated on Linux, it affects all Unicies most likely, and could have fixable scope on Windows.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.  Open Firefox 2.  Go to http://www.ocremix.org/ 3.  Open an mp3 file in Totem et al from the site; do NOT save to disk first 4.  Look at /tmp and find the file name 5.  Google for the file name (without .mp3 perhaps, perhaps parts of it) 6.  Find your way BACK to the original file either directly or through forums 7.  Verify size and filename 8.  Check it out, you just forensically reconstructed your previous activities in minutes!   If it's thunderbird, 1.  Open an attachment from a message 2.  Look in /tmp and find the file name 3.  Ponder what kinds of damaging file names could be there ("drakon_project_TS_finance.xls" could represent a leak of a top secret project name?) Actual Results:   Light information leak.  Expected Results:   Can't find this stuff unless you own the files.  Fixing this is easy.   char tmpdir[20]; char pathname[255]; tmpdir   = mkdtemp("/tmp/firefox_XXXXXX"); /*make temporary directory,                                             mode 0700*/ snprintf(pathname, "%s/%s", tmpdir, filename); /*Make a path at                                                /tmp/firefox_??????/$(filename)*/  Using mkdtemp() like this will allow Firefox to create a unique temporary directory with restrictive permissions in /tmp at startup, and store files in there.  This in turn will prevent other users from simply looking into the temporary directory (because it's drwx------) and seeing the filenames and sizes.|2005-09-10T03:32:56Z

This situation commonly occurs with websites that have "random image" PHP scripts, which becomes rather annoying when you try to save more than one random image from the same script.  This is essentially a variant of bug 146781, which was WONTFIXed because we don't want to request headers from the server before bringing up the Save As dialog. However, in this case, the browser has already retrieved the redirected image, so we've already got the redirected filename, we just needs to hang onto it somehow. Bug 89419, bug 229843, and bug 167047 seem to need much the same kind of fix.   Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to http://interbutt.com/misc/phpimage/test.html 2. Right click on the image and choose Save As   Actual Results:   The Save As dialog appears with the filename "random.php.png".  Expected Results:   The Save As dialog should show the actual filename of the image being displayed, for example "getfirefox_large.png".  In an even odder wrinkle, if you right click on the image and select View Image, the real address of the image shows up in the address bar (it's for a different random image than the one you just saw though so it's not a workaround), but if you then right click, Save As, it suggests "random.php" as the filename (not even "random.php.jpg")! Using File, Save Page As works properly though.|2005-10-09T03:44:00Z

Starting firefox from a shell is useful to start the profile manager or start a second instance with a different profile (useful for testing, in particular). I can see two possibilities:  1. The installer installs the firefox script (or a symbolic link to this script) in some standard location such as /usr/local/bin, possibly asking the user for several locations.  2. Some information is given after firefox has been installed, telling the user what to do. For instance, add /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS to his $PATH (but I don't think this is a good solution since there are other executables the user would probably not want in $PATH). Or add a symbolic link, in which case the installer should give the path to the firefox script (e.g. /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox).

332690|ajaxSketch breaks handling of local SVG files|x86|File Handling|2006-04-04T14:00:55Z|||I finally got round to playing with ajaxSketch today, and unfortunately discovered what seems to be a rather serious problem in the way Mozilla saves MIME types it hasn't seen before.  To provide the save functionality ajaxSketch sends the drawing with the MIME type "x-type/x-doc" to put up the "What should Firefox do with this file?" dialog. When Firefox saves the file it stores a record of this previously unencountered MIME type along with the filename extension .svg in mimeTypes.rdf (on MS Windows at least).  It appears when you open a local file, Firefox always goes to mimeTypes.rdf to obtain the MIME type corresponding to the file's filename extension first. Only if mimeTypes.rdf doesn't have anything useful does it ask the OS for the MIME type. Unfortunately, after saving an ajaxSketch drawing, Firefox thinks that files with the .svg filename extension have the MIME type "x-type/x-doc" (because that's what's now in mimeTypes.rdf). Since Firefox doesn't know what to do with files of this type, it will now ALWAYS put up the "What should Firefox do with this file?" for local .svg files and will be unable to open them itself. The user will suddenly be unable to view SVG files that previously worked on their computer.  I don't know how many people have given ajaxSketch a try, but I guess there are now considerably more people out there with a corrupt mimeTypes.rdf than before, and that the numbers will continue to increase until hish/michaelr change what ajaxSketch does. (I've mailed them explaining the problem and asking them to remove the Save functionality until they find another way to do it.)  It seems clear to me that this is a bug in Mozilla. Maybe Firefox should go to the OS *before* looking in mimeTypes.rdf? Or maybe it shouldn't save stuff to mimeTypes.rdf if the OS already has an entry for the filename extension that would be stored with the MIME type?  A secondary issue is what we're going to do with the people with a corrupt mimeTypes.rdf? Fixing the file manually would be a pain for people, and if there are enough of them, then maybe a small extension/bookmarklet could do the job automatically? Thoughts?|2006-04-04T14:00:55Z

If you use just 'foo.net' it works.  The code in question is here:   http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/extensions/auth/nsHttpNegotiateAuth.cpp#390  At first, I thought I spotted it right away:  431     const char *end = matchHost.EndReading(); 432     if (PL_strncasecmp(end - hostLen, hostStart, hostLen) == 0) { 433         // if matchHost ends with host from the base URI, then make sure it is 434         // either an exact match, or prefixed with a dot.  we don't want 435         // "foobar.com" to match "bar.com" 436         if (matchHost.Length() == hostLen || 437             *(end - hostLen) == '.' || 438             *(end - hostLen - 1) == '.') 439             return PR_TRUE;  This says the needle must match the haystack exactly or begin with a '.' or the character preceeding the first character must be a '.'. But I tried:    foo.net,https://.foo.bar  and it still didn't work. So I'm not sure what the problem.  Note you have to restart the browser after editing prefs.js.

I'm also using the "open downloaded files" option to open these files in their associated programs.  It works as I'd expect, however when I click a link to a file that's on my local machine it copies that file from it's location into my download folder.  Then I unfortunatly have two copies of it, which I think is wrong.  I think Camino should take a page from Safari here and if the file being "downloaded" is local, just open the file where it is without copying it, or, if the user doesn't have "open download files" checked, should just show you where in the OS the file is like Safari does.  To me this is more intuitive and makes more sense for testing and building content that is stored on a local machine so you don't have copies of files filling up the machine when you don't need to.  It's making my current project where that needs to be local really messy.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Make an html page that links to a local file 2.

In many cases, we need to know what extensions are installed, and there's no way to simply copy and paste that info into a support post (They would need the info-lister extension).

If I disable JavaScript, only ONE tab is opened, but I suspect that's because the page containing the link is a normal html page, not a frameset page.  This is easily demonstrated by turning off Preferences->Content->Enable Javascript.  Then login to a gmail account that has received a Mozilla Forum response, which I know contains target="_blank".  If I hold down my Command key and click the link in the email to visit the Mozilla response, I get TWO TABS opening at the same time.  I'm on a Macintosh OSX 10.4.9 system with Firefox 2.0.0.4.  This does NOT happen in Safari, which tells me the link will go to a new window, but which opens only one window even if I hold down my Command key.  This bug was mentioned in Bug 279223, Comments 17 & 18.  Bug 279223 concerns the Status Bar showing more information, which would have been helpful in avoiding this bug.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.Disable JavaScript, clear the cache 2.Display any page that contains a link with target="_blank" that is NOT visible with View Source, such as a link imbedded in a frameset. 3.Hold down the Command modifier key (new window/tab key), and click the link. Actual Results:   Two identical tab windows are opened.  Expected Results:   Only one tabbed window  Windows systems will probably have to use Tools->Options to change Content disabling Javascript, and to Clear Cache (Advanced->Network).

This is an issue if the system default changes and the user has selected "remember my choice".  With Gnome this is an extra concern because there is no check that the system default still exists as required for bug 389632.  Steps to reproduce:  * Install evince.  * Set up a safe handler in a shell:   gconftool-2 --type string --set /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/ssh/command "echo %s"  gconftool-2 --type boolean --set /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/ssh/enabled true  * Use firefox to load an existing URL (on a host with public/private key access   or similar) of the form:     ssh://_hostname_/home/_user_/_filename_.ps  * Select "echo %s" from the protocol handler dialog,  * Select "remember my choice for ssh links",  * Press OK.    (ssh://_hostname_/home/_user_/_filename_.ps is output to stdout)  * Disable the safe handler:   gconftool-2 --type boolean --set /desktop/gnome/url-handlers/ssh/enabled false  * Reload the URL.  Expected behaviour:   A dialog because the selected application is no longer available (through   the system).  Actual behaviour:   evince is launched with no warning.  I don't know whether evince runs postscript in safe mode or not, but there could be a different default mime-type handler such as "lpr".  I haven't checked whether or not there are similar issues with remember to "use system default" for mime-types.  (sftp: protocols are handled by gnomevfs extension [nsGnomeVFSProtocolHandler not nsExternalProtocolHandler] which results in a dialog after download to select an application based on mimetype.)|2007-08-01T00:42:46Z

393122|external helper app service / handler info simplification tracking bug|All|File Handling|2007-08-21T23:48:34Z|[proto]||During the various web-based protocol handling work that we've been doing, a bunch of possible ways to simplify the external helper app service and handler info have suggested themselves.  Rather than filing all the possible bugs now, I'll list some of changes I suspect we'll want here, and we can spin off individual bugs as we get to them and make them block this one.  Some (most?) of these changes are likely to break ports when they happen, but they should collectively make this code less fragile and easier to maintain.  A) split out nsLocalHandlerApp to have a default implementation which can be overridden by an OS-specific one.  B) have each nsIHandlerApp have its own implementation of LaunchWithURI and LaunchWithFile.  C) make the OS default handler be its own nsILocalHandlerApp, possibly just a subclass of the OS-specific nsLocalHandlerApp.  Doing these things allows LaunchWithURI and LaunchWithFile on the nsI{MIME,Handler}Info to simply call through to the appropriate nsIHandlerApp rather than sending things through a bunch of somewhat complex logic.  Further down the road, some other things that would be good to do would be:  D) right now, nsI{MIME,Handler}Info is initialized from OS-specific data (if any exists), and then passed up to the helper app service that fills in any data persisted in RDF.  This is object model makes it somewhat difficult wrap one's head around how it all fits together.  I think the OS-specific data wants to simply be a separate object implementing something like nsIOSHandlerInfo which contains any and all data that comes from and/or is persisted by the OS itself.  This could then be an attribute on nsI{MIME,Handler}Info.  E) Make all reading and writing of the RDF data persistence happen through nsIHandlerService.  This includes stuff that's currently done manually in the external helper app service and the unknown content-type handler dialog.  At some point, it's possible that all of this persistence stuff wants to really happen in the front-end code, and none in the external helper app service; I'm not entirely sure.  F) we may also want to split up the nsIMIMEInfo and the protocol handlers, but some of these other refactorings may make that less worth doing.|2007-08-21T23:48:34Z

394699|With "open in same window/tab" pref, target=_blank can exit browser|x86|File Handling|2007-09-03T03:46:10Z|||Links to mime types that require an external application can exit the current tab or window (and potentially the whole browser session) if you set your preferences so that target="_blank" opens in the current window and tab.  For example, I have: user_pref("browser.link.open_external", 1); user_pref("browser.link.open_newwindow", 1);  Now make a page which does this: <a href="foo.pdf" target="_blank">click here to exit</a> (where foo.pdf points to an actual pdf file somewhere, or some other file type that would call up the helper app dialog).  With only one window and one tab visible, click on the link.  The current window disappears, then the mime type helper app dialog appears. Sometimes you can call up the helper app, sometimes not (there might be a race condition there) but the important thing is that no matter what, you've lost your browser window.  I haven't tried this with mime types that don't display the helper app dialog.  In bug 346561 ("Always close useless tabs/windows opened for external handling") the first comment is "We already do this for windows opened through target="_blank" and window.open(...)." I suspect that the "already do this" code is being a bit too eager, and not noticing whether a new tab or window is actually opened before deleting the current one. The code should check whether it actually opened a new window, and only in that case should it close it.|2007-09-03T03:46:10Z

402138|Third-party content handlers can leak intranet URIs|All|File Handling|2007-11-02T00:49:44Z|[proto]||Section 4.5.1.1 of the current WhatWG draft sez the following about leaking intranet URIs:  Leaking Intranet URIs. The mechanism described in this section can result in secret Intranet URIs being leaked, in the following manner:     1. The user registers a third-party content handler as the default handler for a content type.    2. The user then browses his corporate Intranet site and accesses a document that uses that content type.    3. The user agent contacts the third party and hands the third party the URI to the Intranet content.   No actual confidential file data is leaked in this manner, but the URIs themselves could contain confidential information. For example, the URI could be https://www.corp.example.com/upcoming-aquisitions/samples.egf, which might tell the third party that Example Corporation is intending to merge with Samples LLC. Implementors might wish to consider allowing administrators to disable this feature for certain subdomains, content types, or protocols.  The one way I could think of to implement this to some degree would be to have a list of the RFC 1918, and not allow URIs from inside that address space (assuming that's where the user is) to be sent to content handlers outside it.  I imagine there'd be issues with proxies.  I seem to remember mconnor thinking about this for some other feature, so I'm CCing him here.

402144|web-based content handlers could leak secure URIs|All|File Handling|2007-11-02T01:24:05Z|||Section 4.5.1.1 of the current draft of WhatWG sez:  Leaking secure URIs. User agents should not send HTTPS URIs to third-party sites registered as content handlers, in the same way that user agents do not send Referer headers from secure sites to third-party sites.  When I asked Hixie about the rationale for this, he referred me to the paragraphs above it about leaking intranet URIs.  Note that he didn't really know what the exact rationale for the Referer stuff was.  I presume the theory is that if you care enough to encrypt a site, than you probably want its contents kept private.  Not crazy, but that's an awfully large hammer for this nail.  My inclination is to not implement this restriction, but I'm conflicted about this.  Alternate ideas encouraged...|2007-11-02T01:24:05Z

It probably wants a link to the application prefs dialog.  It might also want to behave differently depending on how registerProtocolHandler was invoked: if it was just done while loading the page (see nsPIDOMWindow::IsLoadingOrRunningTimeone), then we probably wouldn't want to show it.  If it's done from an explicit action, we probably would want to show it. An alternative to this modal behavior might be a way for websites to test if their handler is already registered.

402736|web-based handlers should open in a separate window/tab|All|File Handling|2007-11-06T18:47:25Z|[proto]||At the web-based protocol design/security review, dveditz suggested that we would do well to open web-based handler links in a new window/tab, as this would restrict the ability of content in those links: at the very least, it would prevent them from forcing that browser to execute back or forward.  Dan, were there other safety measures that this would also provide?  Right now, we only open in a separate window/tab if this is done from the "Send To..." context menu item in Firefox.  Clicking an a link opens the handler in the existing browser element.  If we were to make this change, it would make the user experience for web-based handlers more like that of local applications in that the existing browser would be left untouched.  Arguably, though, this is just exacerbating existing poor UI of making certain links do something other than navigate in the current browser frame, which is different from what most links do most of the time.  I suspect this UI decision might want to be made simultaneously with a decision for 400886, since to some degree, they're both parts of the same issue.  Coherent UI here should block 1.9, I think.|2007-11-06T18:47:25Z

Quick summary: The IBM download site uses two windows to initiate a download. One to select the kind of file, which then launches a new window with the URL of the file that then closes itself. Previous to the patch for  bug 355222 that would fail, so as a quick fix we disabled the code that would attempt to close the window used for download, so that we could use it as a context to pass to nsIHelperAppLauncherDialog::show.  Instead, we should probably try to do something better, like closing it and using it's parent as the context. We didn't take this solution in that bug because I am worried that we'll have no way to ensure that it's parent is actually related (from a user's perspective) to the window that actually triggered the download.|2007-11-08T03:13:37Z

Crash report  Date/Time:      2008-02-14 00:43:20 -0500 OS Version:     10.3.9 (Build 7W98) Report Version: 2  Command: firefox-bin Path:    /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin Version: 2.0.0.12 (2.0.0.12) PID:     435 Thread:  Unknown  Link (dyld) error:  dyld: /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin Undefined symbols: /Users/lizzeymac/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/mkao76e1.default/extensions/{000a9d1c-beef-4f90-9363-039d445309b8}/components/libgears.dylib undefined reference to ___cxa_atexit expected to be defined in /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib   Expected Results:   After installing Gears extension, FF should restart, go to my Google Reader page (with 'offline' not Blue/offline or Green/online button in upper right menu), a window should open asking if Google Gears should function on/allow this page, I click yes, then the 'offline' disappears and the blue/green button appears. With Gears installed I should be able to log in to Reader, refresh the RSS feeds, click the Green button to cache the RSS feeds and go 'offline' to read the feeds  without an internet connection.   I have reproduced this at least 5 times. I don't use themes, this happens after all other extensions have been completely removed and with all the same extensions that have been used for months.  I have deleted all FF and mozilla files and caches, restarted, fixed permissions, logged in as a different user on my Mac, I installed an earlier FF 2.0.0.2 and deleted same after it crashed in exactly the same way, installed the newest ff2.0.0.12 from a freshly downloaded dmg and the exact same thing happen. I have searched Gears help and there isn't anything there.  There is something seemingly similar in the  Google Gears Discussions about a month ago but no  one offered any suggestions and no Reader Guide responded.  Any help would be greatly appreciated, I hope I have provided the correct information.   I appreciate that this is not  a major issue for many FF users but it is extremely frustrating for me personally, but more importantly  I have set up Gears on the computers at the  community center where I volunteer and on a few clients computers. The clients use it to read RSS feeds for the newspapers from their countries of origin, to practice reading English, and to study current events.  Gears allows people who do not have cable/broadband free access to as many RSS feeds as they like without tying up their phone with dial-up service, and it works on older computers.  These computers (virtually the same set up as the one listed here) are all having the same problem. Thanks. Lis|2008-02-14T06:56:43Z

422953|Notification bar does not catch the eye on Windows XP|x86|Theme|2008-03-14T16:43:02Z|||Created attachment 309448 Screenshot of notification bar on xp  In this Firefox nightly, check out the notification bar (screen shot attached). I understand that we've themed it to look like part of the tab bar, but I find that the notification bar just doesn't "pop".  It looks almost "grayed out" which conveys "disabled" to my mind.  So, my first thought when I saw it was that something was wrong with the bar itself.  But then I realized it was just the theme.  If we pop up that bar to catch people's attention, then I think it should be more noticeable.  The one on Mac OS is very nice in this regard, it comes up as a blue bar and immediately catches the eye.  1. Go to a site where you've never logged in before, type in a user name and password (either real or invalid) 2. Click "login" and see the bar.  Note that you can also activate the bar a number of other ways.  = Actual = The notification bar doesn't catch the user's eye  = Expected = The bar really should catch the user's eye  Tested this on:  Mozilla/5.0(Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b5pre) Gecko/2008031405 Minefield/3.0b5pre|2008-03-14T16:43:02Z

The first attachment shows the Delete and Undo icons found on the most widely used platform's File Manager, next to Firefox's current nightly different button icons, Stop and Reload.  For four years Firefox has successfully used a clear octagon stop sign with white interior, subtly emulating a widely recognised stop sign to be clearly defined.  As well as the single red colour now matching very closely, an X emulates Delete even more closely, leaving a near match.  Reload from Fx 2 lost one of it's arrows, and in Fx 3 currently it's thickness, leaving one thin arrow much like Undo/Redo in Windows Explorer, and even Microsoft Office, Open Office and more.  The colour has also been darkened, again leaving a near match.  Whilst one admires aspiring to develop a brand and difference to other programs, this should not be at the expense of usability.  They break what novice users are used to not only in terms of basic icon recognition in Windows (nativity) and more, but also previous Firefox versions.  For 4 years Firefox has consistently successfully used the clearer stop and reload icons.  The new icons make it far easier for novice users to mistake them for Delete, Close, Undo, Redo icons they see very often in Windows Explorer, MS Office, Open Office, and many more.    This issue must be addressed as it breaks long term established standards novice users are used to seeing, nativity, and even Firefox consistency.  Reproducible: Always|2008-03-26T23:27:06Z

When uploading exactly the same file, but with that file named "foo.jpg", Fx passes the multipart content-type as image/jpeg. My OS knows how to diagnose a file's content-type without relying on its extension; Fx should use this OS level filetype diagnosis instead of relying on the extension.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. On Ubuntu, with Fx 2.0.0.6, take any JPEG file called whatever.jpg, and copy it to "whatever" (no file extension). 2. Go to http://validator.w3.org/ and click Validate by File Upload 3. Upload whatever.jpg and say Check 4. Note that it says "Sorry, I am unable to validate this document because its content type is image/jpeg, which is not currently supported by this service." -- correctly image/jpeg. 5. Do the same but upload "whatever" (without file extension) 4. Note that it says "Sorry, I am unable to validate this document because its content type is application/octet-stream, which is not currently supported by this service." -- content-type is different for the same file, which means that Fx is identifying the content-type from the file extension, which is not the way to do it on Linux.

The unix subclassing of nsMIMEInfoImpl::GetHasDefaultHandler shouldn't be needed, as the handler info itself should have the info needed to determine if there's a default handler or not (and if it doesn't, it seems like the proper fix would be to make sure it does, eg, by setting mDefaultDescription, or fixing the base class GetHasDefaultHandler to look for the right things).  Bug 423776 added a conservative work-around for nsMIMEInfoUnix::GetHasDefaultHandler() not working for protocol handlers.

In fact, self-signed certificates are allowed under current Web standards, so describing them as invalid might be quite misleading.  "Unvalidated" or "unverified" might be a more accurate description of what is actually meant.  Most of these invalid-certificate popups are false alarms.  The warnings are rather technical as it is, and inaccurate information further confuses an already confusing situation.  This bug is about accurate wording, not about behavior.  It's fine to raise alarms, change behavior, nudge Web standards, halt browsing, blow horns, etc., as long as the information is accurate and correct.  There are previous discussions here: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?p=3362858#3362858 http://www.dria.org/wordpress/archives/2008/05/06/635|2008-05-12T23:18:19Z

And before someone says that the admins can look in firewall logs and similar it is easy for a user to work around that and protect your browsing by using, e.g., an encrypted connection to an external proxy.

434032|gnome-vfs helperapp inconsistencies|x86|File Handling|2008-05-16T11:57:46Z|||Not sure if that is reported somewhere but couldn't find it at least.  Let me explain the issue with an example:  1. a webserver offers a file for download with extension .rpm and mime-type    application/x-redhat-package-manager 2. Firefox offers a default application to handle that type of file 3. if I want to use that default handler it tells me that the helper app doesn't     exist  On my Linux gnome-vfs/shared-mime-info config I have no handler for application/x-redhat-package-manager but only for application/x-rpm and therefore http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/toolkit/system/gnome/nsGnomeVFSService.cpp#214 doesn't return a valid application to http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/uriloader/exthandler/unix/nsMIMEInfoUnix.cpp#68  So the issue is that Firefox seems to find a valid/correct application while checking for the file extension since that maps to application/x-rpm and handles that as "default application". Then the "default handler" is chosen and Firefox doesn't use LaunchWithFile() bot LaunchDefaultWithFile() which uses the original mime-type provided by the server which fails to find the correct application.  I guess Firefox should trust the server provided mime-type and if there is no application configured for that mime-type it probably shouldn't offer it at all? But in case it is offered as at the moment it can't fail later IMHO.|2008-05-16T11:57:46Z

Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: Suppose to open a remote link in a webpage using an application selected in the "open with/save" dialog. Then Firefox downloads the remote file to a temporary location (and IMHO it should be a bit more smart, but this is bug #415441 already), and launches the application with the downloaded file. Good so far. Then, if we close Firefox but not the application, Firefox removes the downloaded temporary file. Actual Results:   The application launched for the (temporary) file can have troubles if it wants to still make use of the file.   Expected Results:   Firefox should not implicitely remove the temporary file, but for example: - leave it around, either permanently or tracking the application launched with fork() [UNIX, of course] - manage explicitely it in the downloads, just like Opera does   This was reported as problem in KDE's bugzilla for the KDE 4 application Okular:   http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=163363  If the users (after doing the steps before, eg fire Okular from Firefox and close Firefox) selects "Save copy as", they are not able to save it, because the only reference to the file (the temporary file, not even the remote URL that basically all the KDE applications can manage) is gone.

One can also hold down <Shift+Ctrl>, and tap a cursor key to highlight  to the beginning of the next WORD left or right.  The physical instance of <Ctrl> or <Shift> doesn't matter: either left or right or a mixture of both sides works the same.   This works correctly if I use the dedicated cursor keys.  However, it does not work correctly if using the NumPad cursor diamond (the Number Pad numbers): instead, the action appears to be mapped to move focus to a different Tab entirely.   This works correctly in the Windows version of FF 2.0.0.15.  AFAICT, it has never worked correctly for any FF 2.x version.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open nine or more tabs, with any sites (I use Google). 2. Change the first tab to point to a site with a text entry box.  For example, www.google.com has a one-line Search field: that'll do. 3. Type some text.  Any text that has spaces and chars will do.  For example, "Mary had a little lamb" 4. With the cursor is positioned at the end of the text (rightmost), hold down <Ctrl+Shift>, tap <CurLeft> to confirm that text marking is working correctly using the dedicated cursor keys.  Text will become highlighted with each tap of <CurLeft>. 5. Repeat, using <Ctrl+Shift>, <NumPad4>. Actual Results:   Tab focus moves to the fourth tab.  Expected Results:   Tab focus remains with the first tab, and text marking to the left occurs.  I have reproduced this aberrant behaviour back to FF 2.0.0.0 .  FF 2.x for Windows works as expected.  SeaMonkey 1.x works as expected.|2008-07-04T05:09:33Z

When bookmarking a new website, particularly via the yellow star, the new bookmark does NOT appear in the bookmarks list anymore.  It disappears into the magic "Unsorted Bookmarks" folder, which is not listed on the "bookmarks" menu dropdown by default.  So essentially, all new bookmarks are falling off the radar and confusing users.  The only way (by default installation) to find them is to go into the unsorted folder under "organize bookmarks".  Of course one can always search from the new bar, but I have found many people still prefer ye olde click ye bookmark in ye menu list.    I realize that there are many ways around this, but this really needs a default fix of at minimum putting the unsorted folder onto the bookmarks dropdown menu by default.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Uninstall Firefox, remove all settings, etc. 2. ??? 3.  Profit.  By which I mean, reinstall Firefox with all default settings. 4.  Bookmark a few sites and watch the wonderment of the bookmarking black hole. Actual Results:   Bookmarks end up in the "Unsorted Bookmarks" folder, available from "Organize Bookmarks" under the "Bookmarks" Menu  Expected Results:   The "Unsorted Bookmarks" folder should be linked by default from the Bookmarks menu, perhaps in the same area as "Recently Bookmarked".

446235|There is no way for an extension to register a protocol cleanly with the new handler system|All|File Handling|2008-07-19T23:49:49Z|||With the new protocol handling system, that allows web apps to register content handlers and so on, extensions which handle protocols have been neglected.  Previously, an extension would register itself as an nsIProtocolHandler and all was well.  With the new interface allowing users more control over their protocol handlers, the old settings are hidden (and in most cases rightly so, as most nsIProtocolHandlers would be internal). Although in the case of most protocols, this handler can be bypassed by setting network.protocol-handler.external.* to true - which is quite voodoo.  Supplying an additional entry in the application selection dialog marked "use internal setting" as an interface to this pref would be one solution. (as suggested in bug 446220 comment #3)  Another cleaner solution (that would admittedly be more work for extension developers) would be to add another component implementing the nsIHandlerApp interface (http://www.xulplanet.com/references/xpcomref/ifaces/nsIHandlerApp.html) that would allow extensions to register with the new service.

Some javascript reduces in a certain event the browser window to 275 pixels wide (using window.innerWidth = 275). With the default theme, this works perfectly.  However, with the Noia 2.0 Extreme theme, there is a problem. The window resizes correctly, but the innerWidth is not correctly set. The innerWidth seems to be set to a value that corresponds to the minimum chrome size, in my case 375. As a consequence, the Flash app is sized to 395 but only part is shown, without browser scrollbars.  This problem does not occur if run in a window that was popped up with parameters "toolbar=No,location=No,status=No,resizable=Yes,fullscreen=Yes", probably because there the chrome is narrower.  It seems that the theme is able to impose a minimum width for its chrome but the browser only applies it half-heartedly: the window.innerWidth property is set to this minimum, but the window can be smaller.  A solution for this problem would be to fix the calculation of innerWidth.   Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create an HTML file with the following contents: <button onclick="alert(window.innerWidth);">Width</button> 2. Install the default theme. 3. Open this HTML file in Firefox and reduce the window width to about 200px. 4. Push the Width button 5. Install Noia 2.0 extreme theme 6. Repeat steps 3 and 4 Actual Results:   With the default theme, the alert will show the correct innerWidth of about 200 pixels. With the Noia 2.0 Extreme, the alert will show an innerWidth of about 395, while the window is really 200 and there are no scrollbars  Expected Results:   In both cases the innerWidth should be about 200.

The tab strip seems to translate all the very small increments as one unique-sized jump of a whole tab, making it very hard to navigate using the aforementioned devices (a very soft movement jumps over three tabs).  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Place the cursor over the tab strip with lots of tabs open 2. Move the mouse scroll, or use the two-finger movement on the trackpad, very slowly Actual Results:   The tab strip scrolls whole tabs for every small movement you do. If you scroll at once more than what should be a few pixels, it becomes almost impossible to keep visual track of the movement.  Expected Results:   The tab strip should scroll very slowly, just like the browser already does on other widgets. That probably means no "rounding" to whole tabs, but a sufficiently smart algorithm could still handle that.  This might also be the case for the other operating systems, since AFAIK Windows does support smaller scrolling increments. But it's probably not as much of an issue, as most popular pointing devices only offer the "stepped" standard increment of 120.|2008-12-04T03:46:25Z

469260|Remove "ask me every time" as an option for cookies|All|Preferences|2008-12-12T04:57:35Z|||If you set the preference for third party cookies to "ask me every time" Firefox displays a modal dialog box for every cookie it encounters.  This is bad for a number of reasons:  -It exposes far too much detail about the underlying implementation of the Web  -It forces the user to make a ridiculous number of decisions before visiting a Web site.  For instance, amazon.com produces 8 dialog boxes, and ebay.com 15.  -Even informed users will not always have enough information to make an informed choice.  With the inclusion of private browsing mode in Firefox 3.1, users will now be able to have sessions where no information is collected about them, or they can opt to have private browsing mode enabled all of the time.  Both of these options are easy to use and understand, and a lot better than trying to micromanage a sequence of 15 modal dialog boxes.  I believe we should move this feature to an extension, and remove it from the core product.  I know we can't really remove features without an outcry from the small percentage of users who rely on them.  This is of course why extensions exist, and the importance of providing an efficient and understandable UI to mainstream users.|2008-12-12T04:57:35Z

472226|Attempt to avoid accidental dataloss by removing "saved passwords" from clear recent history dialog (not history and doesn't respect timeframe)|All|Private Browsing|2009-01-06T00:48:25Z|done in bug 480169||Similar premise to bug 472211 but a different potential problem.  The "Clear Private Data" system has been changed to a "Clear Recent History" system. The dialog is more flexible and allows users to selectively clear only portions of their data and thus might be used more often by people who don't want to wipe everything. There's one problem here: the price of an accident can be high. Most people don't back up their data and if one was to wipe everything when they didn't want to it would be quite bad. One way I think would be useful to attempt to avoid mishaps (aside from adding more confirmation for "everything" in bug 472211) would be to remove the saved passwords wiping checkbox from this dialog.  To start, saved usernames and passwords are *not* "recent history". The placement here is a bit odd with this new terminology. I and many users can wipe their entire history, cache, cookies, form autocomplete, etc. and not have it be a horrible inconvenience. Wipe my saved passwords and I'll be annoyed. I can visit pages again and remake cookies and autocompletes, but I can't guarantee I'll remember all my logins that easily. I could easily foresee a user clearing everything intentionally then a long while later coming back here for a quick history cleanup and not noticing that the saved passwords box is checked. It's my opinion that this is more dangerous than it needs to be.  This data is more important, not necessarily relevant to the currently labeled dialog function, and there is already a button to wipe them all in the password manager. I think it should be safe to remove it from here and could potentially save some users a good bit of unnecessary grief.|2009-01-06T00:48:25Z

Currently, shift+middle-clicking-on-a-folder no longer represents a proper feature of Firefox.  Right now it is doing some kind of "replace the first tab, append the selected folder's contained links next to the first tab, and leave the other, prior existing tabs appended to the end of those".  It would instead be consistent to have it initiate the same functionality as right-clicking on a folder, holding down shift, and then left-clicking on "Open All in Tabs", which opens all tabs in a new window.   If you don't have a middle click button to test this bug, you can instead open two non-blank tabs, then select the first tab, and finally, press ctrl+shift+left-click-on-a-folder to have Firefox present the same buggy behavior.|2009-01-10T11:24:05Z

478719|Allow configuring aliases of known MIME types|x86|File Handling|2009-02-16T11:31:17Z|||I regularly run across plaintext source files and diff files that the remote server has "helpfully" tagged with MIME types of text/x-csrc, text/x-cheader, text/x-patch, etc.. Seamonkey insists on invoking an external program to view these things, but I just want to quickly see them in the browser before deciding what to do next. I want to be able to configure the browser to recognize them as aliases for "text/plain" and then just handle them with the internal text viewer.  After surfing thru MXR it appears the only way to accomplish this is by adding some entry points to layout/build/nsContentDLF.cpp to register some type/alias pairs for it to search thru when deciding what to do with a document. Is this the right place to be looking, or am I in the wrong place?|2009-02-16T11:31:17Z

But, you will also (pardon my french) want to know "where the hell that damn Yamaha bookmark is in my universe of saved bookmarks so I don't have to search for it again!" right?  So, when you do a search on a book mark, and say you are looking for your electric piano URL and you type in "Yamaha", the listing DOES come back with my Yamaha Keyboard URL off the Yamaha site (which is good), but it does NOT list the Firefox bookmark folder (directory) thread on MY MACHINE describing WHERE the bookmark is actually sitting (as it is stored on my harddisk).  If I have a bookmarks folder called ROOT and inside it is PURCHASES and inside it is 2008 and inside that is a bookmark for my Yamaha piano, when I do a search for that bookmark, I want to be shown that it is sitting inside 2008, inside PURCHASES, inside ROOT - or perhaps something like \ROOT\PURCHASES\2008...  Hope this is clear enough.   Seems to me both an obviously useful feature and an oversight.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.  Bookmarks tab ==> Organize Bookmarks ==> search box. 2.  Do a successful search of a bookmark you KNOW exists in your bookmark space. 3.  Look at the display - the location of the bookmark on YOUR MACHINE is not listed. Actual Results:   The obsessive/orderly part of my brain had a fit that I found duplicate bookmarks for the same thing but could not find where they were.  (The real answer you want here is "nothing" - there was no result, because the data requested was not provided.)   Expected Results:   (I hate to say this, but ... ) kinda like Windows Explorer, I had expectations such that when you do a search for a file, it tells you where the file is located.  It should have a "Location" column to tell you what thread of bookmark folders actually contains your "found" bookmark.  Huh, didn't unload my theme to see if it was theme dependent.  Jeez, I hope not.  I'm using Walnut For Firefox 1.8.46 - you should try it, it's lovely.  And, as always ...                         *** Go Firefox.  Death to Microsoft. ***|2009-02-16T12:24:11Z

Maximizing and minimizing occurs in strange ways and the once maximized the window doesn't scale at all. The window can only be either at its default size, maximized or minimized - it cannot be scaled to an intermediate size. I suspect the window should not be resizable at all.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Tools -> Options 2. Double Click the top-bar on the window to maximize it (like all other windows) - it will not maximize 3. Right click the top-bar and click maximize - the maximized window will maximize to take up the entire screen ***including covering the main Windows bar on the bottom***. 4. Double clicking the top-bar of the maximized Options window will now go back to its default size. 5.

Other users change tags a lot.  Right now we default the focus in the Add Bookmark dialog to the title field, which is annoying for users who are heavy taggers and want to quickly tag a new bookmark. I could see how bookmarkers who change titles a lot would be similarly annoyed if we simply changed the default focus.

After switching to "Always ask", it still opened the PDF in my browser. I closed and reopened all Firefox windows, checked that "Always ask" was still selected for PDF and it still opened the PDF in my browser.  In order to solve the problem, I had to switch the option to "Save File" and download at least one PDF document. After this I switched it back to "Always ask" and Firefox finally honored the setting by prompting me when I clicked a PDF document.

Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Change the default setting for PDF from "Use Adobe Reader in Firefox" to "Always Ask" 2. Click a PDF document 3. Actual Results:   It will open in a new tab (or window depending on your Firefox settings)  Expected Results:   You should get a dialog asking if you want to open or save the file  As I mentioned in my description, if you switch the option to "Save File" and download at least one PDF document, you can then switch it to "Always Ask" and Firefox will honor your setting.

The same thing can happen on Windows when the "dont show me extensions for known file types" setting is enabled (which is default for any new installation). Users will even not see this file extension in the save dialog textbox.  Finally when those users will import one of the backups again, they will not be listed because we filter on .json in the open dialog. They could think that the backup wasn't saved correctly.  Steps: 1. Open Library and click on "Import and Backup" -> Backup 2. Replace "Bookmarks 2009-03-25.json" with "test" 3. Click on Save 3. Try to restore the same backup now  As you can see the backup isn't listed because it doesn't have a .json file extension.

Menu Bar: Instead of using the fg[NORMAL] style of the class "*MenuBar*", it uses the  fg[NORMAL] style of the class "GtkMenuItem" 2. Dialogs: Instead of using the fg[NORMAL] style of the widget_class "*MenuItem.*", it uses the theme default fg[NORMAL] style or the fg[NORMAL] style of some other class (which I haven't figured out).  This use of wrong styles is not noticeable when using an all light font on dark background or dark font on light background theme.

Visit URL. (requires a free ubuntuforums.org account)    --> Firefox prompts you to download "lspci.txt", which it recognizes as a plain text document. It helpfully offers to open it with "Text Editor (default)"  2. Click "Ok", to open the file with Text Editor.  ACTUAL RESULTS:  Firefox saves the file, but then craps out when trying to open it, with this message: "/tmp/lspci.txt could not be opened, because the associated helper application does not exist.

489981|Launching Firefox twice quickly reproducibly gives "Firefox is already running" error|x86|General|2009-04-24T14:09:33Z|||[Reported in Launchpad as <http://launchpad.net/bugs/366103>]  Firefox 3.0.9, Ubuntu 9.04  Canonical has begun user testing of Ubuntu and its applications. During our first test, one test subject double-clicked on the Firefox launcher in the panel. She managed to do this at exactly the right/wrong speed to produce a "Close Firefox" error alert: "Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To open a new window, you must first close the existing Firefox process, or restart your system."  I have been unable to reproduce this error using the panel launcher, but it is reproducible from the terminal. Steps to reproduce: 1. In a terminal window, enter "firefox & firefox".  What happens: * A Firefox window appears. * A "Close Firefox" error alert appears.  What should happen: * Two Firefox windows should appear. * No error alert should appear.|2009-04-24T14:09:33Z

Note: This bug is noted on a Win2000 Professional system, AND a WinXP PC.  Reproducible: Sometimes  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Right-click a link, choose 'Save Link As' 2. Alter the title of the filename using the keyboard 3. Try to press the Enter key to complete the task. Actual Results:   Sometimes the Enter key works as it should, other times a second or third button press is necessary, and on some occasions up to EIGHT button presses were needed.

491853|Wrong windows may be restored upon restarting browser (Opened/Closed windows swap)|x86|Session Restore|2009-05-07T13:44:10Z|||Because of the way SessionStore's closed window list is used, namely as a combination of windows closed at shutdown and windows closed during normal operation, closed windows can end up being opened and/or open windows can end up being listed as a closed on a browser restart.  This is the simplest way to trigger this issue: 1. Set Firefox to display windows and tabs from last time. 2. Open 2 windows with 1 tab each going to a different URL.  3. Open the Error console and type the following on 1 line: 4. var win = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/browser/sessionstore;1"].getService(Components.interfaces.nsISessionStore).undoCloseWindow(0); win.close(); 5. Closed the error console and then close the open browser window to shutdown Firefox. 6. Start Firefox again and you'll see that the closed window and open window have swapped.  Repeating steps 4 through 6 will cause the closed and opened windows to continuously swap. If more than one window is closed, then entering #4 above multiple times will cause all closed windows to display and all open windows to be closed.|2009-05-07T13:44:10Z

A flagship project of openness and freedom.  Also, it doesn't suck!  Way to go.  Occasionally a server of mine serves up an error message of about 2302 bytes in length instead of serving up the 500 KB file.  When it does, Firefox-3.5b4 shows me a copy of the file itself (presumably pulled from the cache, since it didn't come from my server) with the first 2302 or so bytes of the file overwritten by the error message.  The resulting corrupted file doesn't even parse according to HTML, of course.  At first I thought that this was a bug in my server, so I opened a ticket on my issue tracker: http://allmydata.org/trac/tahoe/ticket/698 .  In that ticket I attached some examples of the resulting corrupted file (the one with the original text pulled from cache but then overwritten by the error message).  Eventually I concluded that my server wasn't really at fault (it might be giving a crummy error message, but it is still firefox's job to display the crummy error message instead of a mashup of the original file plus the crummy error message!).  I've also reported this on launchpad against the Ubuntu package of Firefox-3.5b4 in Ubuntu Jaunty:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.5/+bug/382444  Thanks!  Regards,  Zooko  Reproducible: Sometimes  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install the Tahoe server and get it to fail in this way.  :-( 2. Point ff-3.5b4 at it, hit reload. 3. Observe interesting mashup of cached content and error message visible in your browser window.  If you don't want to go through all of these steps, please observe the resulting "interesting mashup": http://allmydata.org/trac/tahoe/attachment/ticket/698/wiki.html.bz2 .  I've pasted the first 4000 bytes of the actual result and expected result below.

497081|Mimetype/filetype/content type association handling subsystem behavior becomes buggy after repeated downloading of files|x86|File Handling|2009-06-09T11:49:15Z|||User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1b4) Gecko/20090423 Firefox/3.5b4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1b4) Gecko/20090423 Firefox/3.5b4 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)  I frequently download files using services like iFile.it, and after a few dozen or so downloads, the content type handler starts to forget which behavior is associated with which filetype. (This also occurs when downloading .torrent files from sites like demonoid.com) On every download it asks what should be done with the file (open/save), with the "remember" tick box greyed out. After deleting the mimetypes.rdf file from the config, this will work again for a while, but within a few days this starts all over again. The problem is not limited to win7, as it also happens on winXP (sp2+3) iFile has a sort of captcha system that requires you to request a link first, after which it will give you a link to the file, so it might have something to do with ff not being able to grab some sort of information that it needs in order to ascertain the mimetype, but I really haven't a clue what I'm talking about, so.. An  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.delete mimetypes file 2.save a behavior for a file type (say, .torrent) 3.download any .torrent files from demonoid.com (FF always refuses to remember/apply the settings to files downloaded from this site), or multiple files from iFile. 4. $profit? (sorry) Actual Results:   I get the "what do you want to do with this file" dialog  Expected Results:   it should have remembered what to do with the given file type, and automatically opened it with uTorrent (or saved it to disk)|2009-06-09T11:49:15Z

498447|Most recent upgrade to Firefox seems to kill the Javascript function __dopostback|x86|General|2009-06-15T19:43:43Z|||I will admit that I am somewhat technically out of my league here.  I'll do the best I can.  I have used Firefox for years now as my primary browser.  Among other things, I used it for internet banking.  Since the most recent upgrade, applied by me on June 12, version 3.0.11, I have had trouble with several online backing sites.  Certain links just don't work at all.  If you look in the status bar, these links (at various different sites) are typically wanting to call the javascript function "__dopostback".  Inside my Bank of America account, for example (I can't provide access obviously, since it is inside the secure section) there is a link with the following HREF:      javascript:__doPostBack('accountsctl01$lnkdebit','')  Now this function is defined earlier on the page with the following syntax:  <script type="text/javascript"> <!-- var theForm = document.forms['form1']; if (!theForm) {     theForm = document.form1; } function __doPostBack(eventTarget, eventArgument) {     if (!theForm.onsubmit || (theForm.onsubmit() != false)) {         theForm.__EVENTTARGET.value = eventTarget;         theForm.__EVENTARGUMENT.value = eventArgument;         theForm.submit();     } } // -->  </script>  However, when the link in question is selected, nothing happens and the Error Console will show the error saying:  Error: __dopostback is not defined Source File: javascript:__dopostback('accountsctl01$lnkdebit','') Line: 1  The same happens at the Citibank Website, and I have found a place outside of the secure area.  Go to http://www.citibank.com/us/index.htm and on the top menu bar, select "Find Citi Locations".  Enter a zip code (in my case 99701) and hit the "Find" button.  A window will pop up with a list of citibank locations.  In my case, the first location has an associated link with the text "Hours and Details" in it.  Again, "__dopostback" is the function to be called when that link is followed.  Here is the section from the page source:  <div nowrap><li><a id="ctrlResult_gridResults_ctl02_lbtHoursAndDetails" class="Hyperlinks" href="javascript:__doPostBack('ctrlResult$gridResults$ctl02$lbtHoursAndDetails','')">Hours and Details</a></li></div>  Once again, the function __dopostback IS defined as follows earlier in the page, here is that section from the page source:  <script type="text/javascript"> <!-- var theForm = document.forms['frmLocator']; if (!theForm) {     theForm = document.frmLocator; } function __doPostBack(eventTarget, eventArgument) {     if (!theForm.onsubmit || (theForm.onsubmit() != false)) {         theForm.__EVENTTARGET.value = eventTarget;         theForm.__EVENTARGUMENT.value = eventArgument;         theForm.submit();     } } // --> </script>  However, when you click the link in question, nothing happens, and the Error Console shows the following:  Error: __dopostback is not defined Source File: javascript:__dopostback('ctrlresultctl02$lbthoursanddetails','') Line: 1  This was all working fine in the previous version of Firefox, just a week ago.  It also works fine in IE.  Sorry for the long report, as you can tell, I am out of my technical comfort zone.|2009-06-15T19:43:43Z
498949|nsExternalAppHandler::OnStartRequest should (provide a way to) honor browser.download.useDownloadDir pref (autodownload)|All|File Handling|2009-06-17T17:44:20Z|||Bug 299372 fixed getting the correct filename when invoking Save Link As in Firefox. That fix was ported to SeaMonkey in bug 426742 (with the same implementation logic and Toolkit dependencies).  The problem with the new logic is that the preference to directly save to the default download directory (browser.download.useDownloadDir) is no longer honored. Instead the file picker is always shown now independent from the pref value.  Quoting from bug 498152 comment 3: {{ Before the checkin of bug 426742 [SM; FF: bug 299372] saveLink() was always calling saveURL() which calls internalSave() which calls getTargetFile() (all in contentAreaUtils.js). The latter checks the browser.download.useDownloadDir pref and skips the file picker if that is set to TRUE.  The problem with the new approach is that nsExternalAppHandler::SaveToDisk() only skips prompting for a filename if its first parameter is set. Here it is invoked by nsExternalAppHandler::OnStartRequest() which unconditionally passes nsnull which equals "always prompt". }}|2009-06-17T17:44:20Z

I want to warn you about Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox.  Some time ago Mozilla fixed vulnerability in Firefox described in MFSA 2009-22 (http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2009/mfsa2009-22.html). Which allowed Refresh header to redirect to javascript: URIs. And it's good that you fixed this hole.  This vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 3.0.9. And recently, 06.07.2009, I found possibility to bypass this protection in Firefox. Also this method of XSS attacks works in Mozilla (1.7.x) and Chrome.  To bypass protection from JavaScript code execution via refresh header it's needed to use data: URI, which will be containing requisite JS code. This method of conducting of XSS attacks via meta-refresh tag is already known - it was in XSS Cheat Sheet (http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html) already in 2006 year. And I used it to bypass protection in Firefox and to conduct attacks via refresh-header redirectors.  XSS:  Meta-refresh tag and refresh header attack vectors:  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWUpPC9zY3JpcHQ+">  With request to script at web site:  http://site/script.php?param=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWUpPC9zY3JpcHQ%2b  Which returns in answer the refresh header and the code will execute in the browser:  refresh: 0; URL=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWUpPC9zY3JpcHQ%2b  Via data: it's possible to bypass in Firefox 3.0.9 and higher (I tested in 3.0.11) prohibition on JavaScript code execution in refresh header. But in Firefox 3.0.11 you can't get to cookies this way, but it's possible in old Mozilla.  Vulnerable version is 3.0.11 and previous versions (and 3.5 should be also vulnerable).  I mentioned about this vulnerability at my site (http://websecurity.com.ua/3315/).

Additionally, we are seeing 10 - 12 inch screen sizes in netbooks, with increasing pixel counts. Also - more and more, laptops are becoming most of the computer market.  Firefox icons are raster images, so they look smaller as screen resolutions increase. In fact, the 24-pixel "large" icons can be inscrutable for some users.  I would like to request that Firefox enable additional icon sizes. IIRC, the capacity was built in a few years ago. Having this capacity would allow the default and third-party themes to provide small, medium and large icons to allow for greater flexibility in user experience. At the least, three sizes.  Reproducible: Always     As an example of a theme that use 24-pixel icons for "small" and 32-pixel icons for "large," see the Aeon theme. To see a theme that uses 32-pixel and 48-pixel icons for "small" and "large," see Aeon Big. Of course, there is also Aeon Jumbo, with its 48px and 64px icons.  I would recommend the following labels for icon sizes:  16px - x-small 24px - small 32px - medium 48px - large 64px - x-large  Even if the default theme does not make use of the additional icon sizes, third-party themers could do so.   Of course, svg icons would obviate the need for this, but I believe what I propose could be done now, where any svg icon capacity would lie sometime in the indefinite future.|2009-08-02T15:19:54Z

In fact, I can't work without it :P  The new tabbed switcher was great on Windows and Linux, never did it ever not work. You see, it was really great that when pressing CTRL+Tab that you could see nine of your open windows, all presented in the format of the last used tab. And this was without any extensions!  But then one sad day, this beautiful feature in Firefox died. It got removed from both the Windows and Linux builds. I mean, sure, even though it did work better on Windows (transparent... mmmmm!) seeing the open windows, and being able to switch between them all without needing any extensions was a plus.  Please, please PLEASE! Bring back the new (or is that old - after it got removed) way to switch tabs by using CTRL+Tab. I really loved this feature; and now that I have used it, I really want it back!  Reproducible: Always|2009-09-08T00:05:50Z

I've been chasing this bug for several months in my own application, but it turns out that fault lies within Firefox's handling of external protocols. When a user clicks an application link, Firefox runs an arbitrary program(It's random the first time, but consistent after that) in a different folder, which then generally crashes because it is outside its regular working directory and can't find its files.  The users are running Windows, and the protocol handlers are definitely set up correctly in the registry since the handlers work in all browsers but Firefox. Even on the setups where all this fails, the paths are correct in the registry. worth noting is also that this problem can be worked around by closing Firefox, adding a space(!) at the end of the path stored in the registry, and then starting it again which I assume coaxes Firefox into reloading the handlers. Reinstalling Firefox also helps in some cases, but it's something I'd rather not ask of my users since it's a major hassle.  Worth noting is that this bug does not manifest itself on any other browser, when an affected user clicks a link in Opera, for example, everything's just peachy.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click a link using an external protocol handler. Actual Results:   Firefox starts a program other than the one assigned to the protocol handler, but with the expected command line.  Expected Results:   I would expect Firefox to start the expected program with the expected command line.  This problem has manifested itself on completely clean installs, as well as in safe mode, so it cannot be a weird extension that causes it. I have also ruled out user error as a possible cause since most of the affected users are not savvy enough to edit the registry or use about:config to manually screw themselves over.|2009-09-11T22:19:27Z

542990|search suggestion drop-down disappears at inconvenient times|All|Search|2010-01-29T11:14:55Z|||User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)  The search suggestion drop-down frequently disappears while I'm typing a phrase, even if the phrase I'm typing matches the top suggestion exactly.  Let's say I'm searching for "search engines". Having typed "search e", the top suggestion is already "search engines". I notice this, and want to pick this suggestion.  However, due to a mental delay my fingers are still typing, so I end up adding "ng", making the whole phrase "search eng". Most of the time this will work just fine, and the drop-down will still be there after I typed "ng".  Occasionally though, the drop-down will disappear - and not reappear again regardless of how long I wait (unless I type more text).  This is rather frustrating to the user because the drop-down disappears at the exact moment the user is about to actually use it.  Reproducible: Sometimes     I suspect that every time I type something a web request gets made, and if the results don't arrive quickly enough the box is removed.  Suggestion: if the results don't arrive, and a drop-down had previously been shown, leave the (stale) drop-down open (and try to get the results again?), because it's less annoying.  The fact that the box is being refreshed could be indicated somehow - e.g. the "search" icon to the right of the search box could be animated.|2010-01-29T11:14:55Z

It feels faster. Until I remembered an old setting for Mozilla: nglayout.initialpaint.delay I put it to 50 ms, and instantly, Firefox (3.6) feels as speedy as Chrome/Iron.  Maybe the default value should be something like 50 instead of 250. It is a very old value, based on old hardware, and slower connections. It used to make sense when my computer couldn't render that fast. But now that Dualcore @2Ghz and Megabit-connections is common, the repaint delay makes Firefox look slow. Even if the complete page would indeed be painted faster with a higher value (which was the original reason for setting it to 250 ms.)  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: I notice a speed difference with Google Chrome/Iron. Ffx feels slower when surfing. Actual Results:   It doesn't have to feel that way.

559521|Library search results should include containing folder of matching items(s)|All|Bookmarks & History|2010-04-15T08:44:08Z|||User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.0; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3  Library search results should include the containing folder of matching item(s), i.e. the position of the bookmark in the user's bookmarks folder hierarchy. Users typically search for a bookmark because it's not in the expected location in their hierarchy. Assuming the bookmark is found, without knowing what folder it's currently in, there's no way to judge whether it's actually misfiled, except by guessing or manually wading through the entire hierarchy looking for it. This is impractical for large hierarchies, and is also exactly what using search is supposed to avoid.  A simple solution would be to add a "Containing Folder" column to the Library's list control. Assuming it's an optional column, the change would be additive and should not have any impact on existing behavior, thus no one is likely to object to it.  In addition, opening a bookmark in the Library (via Open or double-clicking it) could open and select the containing folder in the folder navigation pane (and also scroll as necessary to make the containing folder visible). The advantage of this method is that the containing folder is revealed immediately in an intuitive way, without the user needing to customize the list view columns. Presumably the parent folder(s) of the containing folder would also be opened, and this would provide a useful context for refiling, since the bookmark's new location is likely to be nearby, e.g. in a parent folder.

559564|Gzipped content (MP3s) & Quicktime Plugin|x86|General|2010-04-15T14:50:32Z|||User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)  The Quicktime Plugin only plays the first few seconds of MP3 files that are sent using gzip compression (Apache's mod_gzip). This doesn't happen with every file, but did with four of the five MP3s I tested. If MP3s are excluded from gzip compression, then they play fine.  I'm not sure if this is a Quicktime Plugin problem or a Firefox problem, but since Firefox is handling the file transfer (I believe), I assume it is a Firefox problem. Plus these files play fine with the Quicktime Plugin in IE.  See the included link where I've posted a detailed description of what happens on Apple's support forums.  A quick summary is that with content that is playing correctly, the Firebug Net panel shows the content is downloaded completely before the Quicktime Plugin controls are displayed and the content is played. With content that does not play correctly, the Quicktime Plugin controls are displayed after only a short bit of the file is downloaded; the plugin plays and stops, and the Net panel shows that the file is still in the process of being downloaded.  Again, turning off gzip compression on the server for MP3 files gets around the problem, but this still seems like a bug that should get fixed (the content encoding used during transfer shouldn't affect what happens once the file content has reached the client).  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: (Happens every time for the same MP3 file, although some MP3s are not affected.)  1. Upload MP3 2. Turn on gzip compression (mod_gzip) 3. Install Quicktime Plugin 4. Access MP3 file directly  Actual Results:   First few seconds play, then player stops (progress bar is all the way to the right indicating that the player thinks that was the entire file)  Expected Results:   Should play fully  Firefox 3.6.3 Quicktime Plugin 7.6.6 Windows XP|2010-04-15T14:50:32Z

But right now URILoader lives in content, and we're hacking around it (bug 562444).     We should figure out how to move URILoader and/or the logic it uses for this into chrome.  Since content processes may load/unload add-ons or extensions that handle specific content-types, this may involve a subscription model where content processes can update the chrome process when they add/remove the ability to handle a certain type of file.  It would be nice to fix this by the time we use e10s/necko for Firefox.|2010-05-06T22:31:55Z

Please make them block this bug, and we will de-dupe if they are indeed exactly the same. Thanks!)  We can detect the network status reliably across all our supported OSes now (if not, let me know), so showing this in the UI is redundant, and confusing.  The only valid case left is for developers that want to test their offline app functionality, so we should make sure there's an extension available for this that they can install for this purpose, or make it available as an about:config preference.  The one thing that needs to be changed in the current approach is that localhost should NEVER be offline. Right now, Firefox automatically goes into offline mode when the network is missing, but also sets localhost (and its associated IP equivalents) to be offline, which confuses the heck out of you if you try to do development locally when without a network.|2010-05-13T02:23:32Z

But some text files do not open in firefox.  Instead a "Opening <name-of-file>" dialog appears and allows the file to be opened with a helper app (e.g. gedit) or saved.  It would be really nice if these files could be viewed in firefox itself (most other text files are viewed).  At the least there should be a "view as text file inside firefox" option in the "Open with" pulldown menu.  An example of a page that cannot be viewed inline: https://cvs.khronos.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=628  Note: the dialog identifies this as "plain text document" so firefox knows what it is.  There is a menu item in the "Open with" pulldown menu named "firefox-3.5.9" but it does not work.  It opens a dialog that says  /tmp/EGL_NK_swap_region2-1.txt could not be opened, because an unknown error occurred.  Try saving file to disk first and opening the file.  Saving the file and then opening the file in firefox works fine.  But it is inconvenient and seems like firefox could simply open the file on its own.

In all cases, the hang occurs either before or immediately after the browser window opens.  Several users have confirmed that safe mode, removing the profile folder, and removing the installation folder have no effect.  Attached is a windbg log from an affected user on 64-bit Windows, for which 32-bit versions of Firefox 3.6.4 hang on startup before any windows can show.  (x64 trunk nightlies worked for this user, and the hang itself occurs immediately after loading C:\Windows\SysWOW64\RpcRtRemote.dll.)|2010-06-24T00:45:32Z

There obviously are some issues to be addressed - such as how to base-64 encode images bigger than the standard limit or if animated images/videos/streaming videos should be embedded, etc. The upside would obviously be not depending on PDF viewers to open saved webpages (e.g. symbian still has no built-in PDF viewer) and, at the same time, pushing open web technologies.

And when the original pdf file changes on the web site, you can't do anything apart from emptying the cache entirely to get the new version if the old version is in your cache. This applies to both saving the file and opening with the external application, and persists after restarting Firefox. This applies to basically all Gecko versions (or, at the very least since 1.8 which is the oldest for which I had the bug reported).

It is IRC-based with a small Flash IRC connector and then all the IRC client activity done in Javascript.  The app opens new pop-up windows for each chat channel. The windows do not have a menu bar or tool-bars.  Whilst trying to debug a minor problem with the app when running on Firefox 4 beta I discovered a problem with the Web Console. My previous experience was with Firefox 3.6.x where the Console is a singleton.  Because the Web Console appears to be bound to each window it is not possible to view problems of new pop-up windows as they are created.  I enabled the Console in the 'Channel List' window (Ctrl+Shift+K) which runs the code that creates the new pop-up 'channel chat' expecting to see logging from the new window but nothing appears.  Once the new pop-up window is created I can enable the Console (Ctrl+Shift+K) but it is empty.  There doesn't appear to be a way to log problems or messages during pop-up window creation.

Don't get the 'feedback' button when FF is installed, so can't send feedback. Can't use Hendrix either. The 'submit' button doesn't work. Hence using 'bugzilla' to report this!  2. More importantly, also true since b3. When you enter a web site address in the web address bar and press enter/return, NOTHING happens. FF Just won't go to a website. Also, does not go to website pressing the 'go to address' button. It happily works fine if I select any bookmark I have, whether from my bookmarks or my history, or link in a page. You just cannot MANUALLY enter a web address in the web address bar and go to a web site.  3. Neither 'back' or 'forward' button has browsing history.

I'm guessing it can no longer access the cookie?  This current build fixed the problem with all my cookies being gone when I exit Minefield/Firefox but this new problem came up which wasn't present before. Thanks.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.Access bit.ly sidebar with the bookmarklet (http://bit.ly/pages/sidebar) on any web page 2. If you are currently logged into bit.ly then it should have your info, if not you can click the link at the top of the sidebar to log in. 3. Try it again.  The sidebar still behaves as if you aren't logged in. Actual Results:   Sidebar behaves as if you aren't logged in to bit.ly even if you are  Expected Results:   Normally the sidebar shows your username and history as well as links to send the shortened links to facebook and twitter if you are logged into your bit.ly account.  The bit.ly sidebar should be able to access the active bit.ly login|2010-10-12T22:19:57Z

Furthermore, during the time the tab is displayed in the current active group, if you right-click over it and try to "Move to Group", no group is displayed.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Get a page which requires password prompt 2. Group your tabs so that the prompting page ends up in a group in the background 3. Restart Firefox Actual Results:   The prompting tab prompts for a password in the foreground and gets added to the group that is currently active  Expected Results:   This is what I'm not sure... should the prompt be in the background too? Is that even possible? Or should the group of the prompting tab be brought to the foreground?|2010-10-13T11:44:56Z

If there isn't a way to [automatically] change the throbber colors during run time, then the color scheme should cater to the default/common GNOME palettes, which are largely blue based. For example, the pinstripe throbber fit fairly well with the GNOME 2.30 Clearlooks theme.  Canonical already maintains their own Firefox package, with their own extension. If they want to change Firefox's theme to match Ubuntu's, then they should be the ones to do it; not Mozilla.  Reproducible: Always|2010-10-18T20:41:32Z

At the moment the only options are either: 1. Block ALL cookies from that domain 2. Require confirmation every time a site sets a cookie  3. Allow ALL cookies from that domain  Now, to go over the options I just mentioned: 1 is impossible as it would prevent you from say, logging into the site in question  2 would result in browsing becoming an impossible experience as in Web 2.0 sites tend to set many cookies, (you would be spending more time verifying individual cookies than browsing).  With 3 You'd be obviously tracked by third parties that the site you visited set cookies on behalf of.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Firefox 2. Visit any site with a modern Google Analytics installation (*utm.js or similar being hosted by the website itself) AND that requires a login 3. Inspect cookies Actual Results:   Data broker successfully set cookie in addition to the website's own login cookie (even if you have the data broker's domains blocked to set cookies). User will note they will have a cookie with __utm in its name and an ID as its content as a _FIRST PARTY_ cookie.  Expected Results:   Cookies should be able to be filterable not only on domain but name and perhaps content as well, this would permit people to secure their browsing further and aid to prevent tracking by unauthorised third parties. I must emphasize unauthorized.  The fact of the matter is, per-domain cookie filtering is no longer sufficient as ad and data brokers have webmasters set (and read) cookies on their behalf via the webmaster's site's domain, (which cannot be blocked or it causes session/login problems).   The endgame of this situation is that cookies have become an important and almost obligatory experience in today's web experience, there really is no more "I do not accept ANY cookies", therefore users must be able to have refined filtering control over those cookies as to EITHER accept or deny based off of more than domain names, domain names come cheap today, but also the other aforementioned conditions. At the moment, as mentioned in the description, users can no longer opt out of these malicious cookies as brokers find more and more inventive ways to install them on user computers without any way for users to opt out.|2010-11-15T11:14:03Z
612812|remove text shadows from tab text|x86|Theme|2010-11-17T05:35:00Z|||Tab titles are currently rendered with a text-shadow.  Especially in the case of inactive tabs where the background is darker, this leads to text that is blurry and tiring to read.  In Firefox 4 we've switched to using DirectWrite by default.  DirectWrite text rendering is much more subtle than Cleartype GDI rendering, so when a text shadow is placed on it the text tends to get washed out.  I would strongly recommend removing the text-shadow from tab title text.  Bug 594324 has a lot of background info related to this.|2010-11-17T05:35:00Z

613580|Shift-clicking the back button or middle-clicking it with browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick=false flashes the tabbar|x86|Tabbed Browser|2010-11-19T21:18:21Z|||User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101013 Firefox/4.0b8pre Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0b8pre) Gecko/20101013 Firefox/4.0b8pre  Click actions on the back and forward buttons that will result in a new window, when the tabbar is auto-hidden because there is only one tab, briefly show the tab=bar with a single tab.  Then the tab-bar disappears again and a new window opens.  This behaviour was introduced by the fix for bug 609700.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Set browser.tabs.autohide true (and optionally set browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick false) 2. Open a window containing a single tab so that the tabbar auto-hides 3. Browse from one page to another to activate the back button 4. Shift-click the back button (or middle click if browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick is false) Actual Results:   The tab-bar briefly flashes a single tab before a new window appears, then the tab-bar is gone again.  Expected Results:   The new window should appear without showing the tab-bar, as happens with shift-clicks and middle-clicks on links and other elements.  At no point is there more than one tab in any window and browser.tabs.autohide is true.  A quick loook at the patch for the fix to bug 609700 suggests that the initial click opens a new tab which causes the tab-bar to appear, then the tab is cloned out to a new window which causes it to disappear again.|2010-11-19T21:18:21Z

After I change the window size by taking it out from maximize, the drawing area scales incorrectly compared to the area it uses. The mouse actually registers components according to the actual area, but the window itself is drawn on smaller area. If I restart firefox, it uses that size for the windows as base, and does the wrong scaling according to it.  This problem has something to do with NVIDIA drivers, because when I installed new drivers from 197.77 to 260.99, the time after the windows uninstalled older drivers, and I didn't have any driver at all, the firefox was working properly, but after the new version of NVIDIA drivers were installed, the problem reappeared.  My guess is, that this has something to do with the NVIDIA drivers, and using non-native resolution. Since I am using VGA-cable, I have no option to distinct between using NVIDIA own scaling, or letting my monitor to do the scaling for me.

The button in question is replaced by the "Go to address in location bar button", which is somewhat logical if the URL were changed, but certainly not when the URL is left corresponding to the current page.  In any case, it seems undesirable to me to loose the ability to use the usual method of managing a page's bookmark, even if the URL has been changed.  I'm aware that you can always bookmark a new page from the "Bookmarks" menu in the menu bar, but once you have touched a URL you loose the ability to manage the current pages bookmark without firing up the bookmark manager and finding the corresponding bookmark.

In addition to our in location bar UI for displaying link targets, we should also provide a tooltip directly on links which shows the full target URL.  This is slightly less efficient for users since they have to wait long enough for the tooltip tip to display while hovering, but it is also more contextual, and allows us more room to display the entire link (in some some situations portions of the URL can get cropped in the location bar).  For links that already specify a tooltip, we should not override it.|2010-11-24T03:41:14Z

Normally Perspectives will find the cert and override the stop screen.  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~perspectives/firefox.html  When trying to change my password or email on amazon.com, it normally replaces a spinning wait icon with a catchpa from https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/  or similar (look through the page source) which I had not authenticated.  Firefox did not load that image, which is good, but it gave no visible indication on the page, in a notification, or anywhere I could easily find that some content on the page was blocked or that it did not load because of a bad certificate.  I've disabled most of the CAs because many were like the Turkish government, and I wonder if you will enable things from China.  The moment these are recognized, EVERYTHING signed by them becomes valid.  I don't want "mixed CA" content any more than mixed content on a secure page (at least unless I know what is going on).  There may be other/better ways of doing this, but Firefox should not merely change the main page if there is a CA problem, it should pop up something if ANYTHING loaded on the page has an invalid cert and give me the option to view or bypass.  With one of the responses to firesheep being converting everything to https:// URLS - but NOT fixing the sources (so you get X.s3.amazon.com, Y.s3.amazon.com, etc. with different certs), this becomes a problem.  some javascript silently doesn't run.  Images don't appear.  But neither is there any indication that something has been stripped out.  If it is an IFRAME, I do see a tiny version of the certificate error page inside the small box allocated for the original.   Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Disable CA for everything amazon.com. 2. Try to change account password. 3. You get the stop passport CA bad image, bypass that one. 4. Password change appears, but is missing chunks.  Alt: 1. Disable s3.amazon.com signer CA, 2. Go to github.com 3. See a really junky page  Show page source, type in each https://X.Y.amazon.com URL domain in the bar, get the stop, CA page, add exception.  if you manage to get them all, the main page will reload correctly. Actual Results:   Weird and broken pages with gobs of content (any signed css, javascript, image, etc.) missing with no easy way to detect this is happening, nor any easy way to correct it.  Expected Results:   Some security warning for any invalid CA for embedded content loaded by the page similar to the warning for the actual page, preferably with a way to override.  I am not marking it as a security vulnerability, nor giving this a higher priority at the moment, but there might be a way to exploit this.  And as much as I trust Mozilla, I don't necessarily trust every CA you have set to default, and then it is easy to quietly wiretap (a security now episode covered the topic).  I expect google.com to be signed by Verisign or similar, not by some entity in another continent, nor should it change, which is what perspectives detects.  Or if someone has added a self-signed CA for other reasons...|2010-12-26T21:33:42Z

The mouse-over highlighting of the list items doesn't work anymore though. The list window goes away when clicking anywhere on the page, it doesn't seem to cause further problems.

624595|tab labels (with overflow ellipsis) jitter as tabs resize|x86|Tabbed Browser|2011-01-11T00:57:51Z|fixed by bug 658467||On OS X, we center tab labels regardless of whether they overflow. When a tab label does overflow, the label's text is truncated at a discrete number of characters while the tabs are resizing, which results in the label jittering back and forth.  This bug has become especially visible since we now have tab opening and closing animations.  Unfortunately, the XUL text widget code doesn't expose to front-end code whether a label's text is overflowing/cropped, so we can't do something like the following, which would left-align a label when the ellipsis is present:  tabLabel.onoverflow = function() label.setAttribute("overflow", "true"); tabLabel.onunderflow = function() label.removeAttribute("overflow");  .tab-label[overflow] { text-align: left; }  A theoretical crop="fade" or text-overflow: fade; that behaved like Google Chrome's tab label overflow would also resolve this issue.|2011-01-11T00:57:51Z

However, there are no such characters in these files. (I checked that using a hex editor. I have also validated the XML files.) When I delete the section from the XML file where the imaginary character is supposed to be, Firefox may or may not give me the same error at a different position, depending on how many parts I have deleted. Unfortunately, the XML files contain sensitive information, so I can't show them publicly. I have not yet managed to create a dummy file that results in the same behavior. The files are encoded with UTF-8 and contain lots of CDATA sections with Windows-style line breaks (CR LF) in them.  Reproducible: Always    Expected Results:   Display the XML tree.|2011-01-18T02:21:28Z

It happens on many different websites and it seems that no pop ups are being blocked  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1.go to http://www.popuptest.com/ 2. click the links and test all of their pop ups 3. Actual Results:   This shows that the pop up blocker doesn't block everything. While on my computer it blocked  most of the pop ups, it failed on some. I feel that this site is obviously shooting out pop ups, and your software may know how to block most of these, while newer pop ups could be out that are not listed on this site. Firefox failed on the drop down banner and sticky pop ups tests.    While I couldn't reproduce the results, I believe it was because I do not keep a record of every pop up that has happened lately.

Sometimes (~1 in 20 times changing the tabs bar) the tabs never become visible again and cannot be selected, requiring a restart. Also, the top "line" of firefox (directly above the tabs, contains the close/maximize/minimize buttons and the website name) flickers when typing or scrolling. Neither of these occured in any of the previous versions of Firefox (3.6.x as well as 4b6, 4b7, or 4b8), nor do they occur in Firefox 4b9 under Windows XP or Windows 7 Ultimate x64. Opening the Add-ons page also suffers from the effect, with all of the elements not appearing until moused over (see http://tinypic.com/r/w8qhxw/7 ).  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Preferably use a 2006 Macbook Pro (version 1,1) with a 2.0ghz Core Duo, 2048mb ram (500+ mb free, not a page file/swap problem - no pages occuring), and a Radeon mobility X1600 gpu with 128mb GDDR3 memory running on OS X 10.6.6 with all software/firmware updates applied. 2. Do anything that changes the on screen appearance of the tabs bar. 3. Alternatively, open the Add-ons page.  Actual Results:   Tabs disappear as described in the summary.  Expected Results:   The tabs should remain visible and the top bar should not flicker.

Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open the Firefox menu 2. Put your mouse over a split menu arrow (the > thingy) 3. Wait a bit for the submenu to open Actual Results:   The arrow button never got to hover state, not immediately after the mouse got over it, and not after the submenu opened  Expected Results:   The arrow button should get into hover state immediately, and keep that way.

This error prevents both an audio and video tag in the page from loading completely (spinner animation never ends; anchor tag to media elements: http://www.storiesinflight.com/html5/#audio - this is a long page).  I've tried an older version of MooTools (1.2.x) with the same result. I've also tried to create a smaller version of the page to limit the complexity, but it's pretty straightforward: With MooTools I get this error, without not. Now I do have another page on this server with MooTools 1.2 and audio tags and no error message here: http://www.storiesinflight.com/jsfft/visualizer/index.html  The error is very baffling since I can not find an instance of "valueOf" anywhere at all...  Also, this page works perfectly fine in the latest Firefox 3.x - this is a 4.0beta9 issue only.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Load page http://www.storiesinflight.com/html5 2. Check error console ("Permission denied to access property 'valueOf'") 3. Check here http://www.storiesinflight.com/html5/#audio if audio loading spinner is still spinning Actual Results:   JS Error in Firebug: "Permission denied to access property 'valueOf'"  Expected Results:   No error message.

DOM: I do a lot of dom appending in my web apps.  i transform xml, then append the resulting fragment.  about half of the time the screen doesn't finish painting the appended content (when appended into the middle of the document, like list tables and such).  I have to scroll to get the repaint to fire.  APPLICATION WINDOW: when i minimize all windows, sometimes the window will not re-open.  I keep it maximized if that helps.  in order to see the window again, i have to right click firefox window on the panel and 'unmaximize' to see the window again, then i can re-maximize.  FILING BUG: typing text into a textarea that causes it to scroll makes some letters not display randomly.  Reproducible: Sometimes  Steps to Reproduce: DOM: 1. get xml list document 2. transform to table (table rows have css hover background color changes). 3. append to div with display=tableCell (don't know if that is needed but that is how i am using it)  WINDOW: 1. open favorite editor, terminal to watch logs, and browser -> maximized. (just to have many windows open) 2. minimize all windows one at a time or with 'view desktop' button in os. 3. click on minimized window on taskbar / panel to re-maximize it.  FILING A BUG: 1. type text into textarea on bugzilla long enough to scroll textarea.  Pause every once in a while to rest your eyes or think of how to phrase the next sentence Actual Results:   DOM: no visible change to screen or artifacts where changes should be made.  mousing over the rows almost displays the rows.  also changing the size of the window will force a repaint.  WINDOW: Window does not display at all.  changing the size of the window will force a repaint.  FILING THIS BUG: no text displays or artifacts display.  scrolling up and down, hitting keys quickly without pause, or tabbing out of text area causes repaint to finally fire.  Expected Results:   DOM: When changes are made, it should fire a repaint, even if only after all elements are appended or altered.

On other pcs there opens a browserwindow and a small window in which the user is asked with which programm the file should be opened. If the user enters "Seamonkey" and presses "OK" then another browserwindow and small window open in which the user is asked with which programm the file should be opened. And so on ...

There is a lot of useful discussion in that bug about the way the OS marks the default action on the screen, and I don't want to sidetrack it, so I am opening a new bug.  This is a suggestion to prevent data loss in a slightly different situation.  If the user has interacted with the list of tabs to be restored, typically unchecking some of them, and still hits the "Start new session" button, it can probably be assumed that they did not intend to, and would be happy to see a "Are you sure you want to start a new session?" dialog asking for confirmation.

This application doesn't offer the same preferences or configurations on the Mac (OS 10.6.6) as is shown on the Support site for Win OS.

633691|Mitigate clickjacking of about:certerror|All|Security|2011-02-12T06:02:38Z|[sg:moderate][advisory-tracking+]||A site colluding with a MITM attacker can show a fake about:certerror page with the "Add Exception" button of a real about:certerror page for another site showing through an iframe.  If the user judges the front site unimportant and fails to recheck the hostname in the "Add Security Exception" dialog, his/her communications with the back site are compromised.  I have linked a demo for Firefox 3.6 and 4 that targets www.cacert.org (so it will not work if you have the CAcert root enabled or already have a cert override for this site).  The demo assumes browser.xul.error_pages.expert_bad_cert is enabled.  In a real attack, I think one could avoid this assumption by supplying a cert with a related hostname so that the "Technical Details" section of the back page expands and then letting the entire "I Understand the Risks" section (including the toggle) show through.  The only problem is that the width of the errorPageContainer may change when this section opens, and I'm not sure how to make it change on both the front and back pages.  Please consider mitigating this attack.  One possibility: when about:certerror loads in a frame, it could say in place of the button, "To add an exception, you need to <a>open this page in a new tab</a>."  I'm marking the bug private as a precaution.  Please feel free to open it if you judge that it does not need this protection.|2011-02-12T06:02:38Z

I also cannot find help on the Support forum, e.g., McAfee Security.    I am using McAfee, version 1.0.0 patch 1 (915), with McAfee Anti-malware version 9.0.0 patch 1 (4156), DAT version 6251.0000.  This application doesn't offer the same preferences or configurations on the Mac (OS 10.6.6) as is shown on the Support site for Win OS.  Since the security component is unavailable, I cannot access my bank or investment sites, such as E*Trade, and so on.  I am speculating as to whether deleting the browsing history (cache, cookies, etc) may actually be deleting some critical components, but again, this is an uneducated shot in the dark.  I can't think of anything else I have done with the app that would have caused the problem.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. double-click app icon 2. get alert/error msg 3. app starts, runs normally, but unable to access any https:// sites 4. remove app, download, re-install Actual Results:   get the  alert dialog: "Alert <space> Could not initialize the applications security component.

633691|Mitigate clickjacking of about:certerror|All|Security|2011-02-12T06:02:38Z|[sg:moderate][advisory-tracking+]||A site colluding with a MITM attacker can show a fake about:certerror page with the "Add Exception" button of a real about:certerror page for another site showing through an iframe.  If the user judges the front site unimportant and fails to recheck the hostname in the "Add Security Exception" dialog, his/her communications with the back site are compromised.  I have linked a demo for Firefox 3.6 and 4 that targets www.cacert.org (so it will not work if you have the CAcert root enabled or already have a cert override for this site).  The demo assumes browser.xul.error_pages.expert_bad_cert is enabled.  In a real attack, I think one could avoid this assumption by supplying a cert with a related hostname so that the "Technical Details" section of the back page expands and then letting the entire "I Understand the Risks" section (including the toggle) show through.  The only problem is that the width of the errorPageContainer may change when this section opens, and I'm not sure how to make it change on both the front and back pages.  Please consider mitigating this attack.  One possibility: when about:certerror loads in a frame, it could say in place of the button, "To add an exception, you need to <a>open this page in a new tab</a>."  I'm marking the bug private as a precaution.  Please feel free to open it if you judge that it does not need this protection.|2011-02-12T06:02:38Z

This doesn't work: although the text shows up as selected in google docs, some old selection is pasted into emacs instead.  This is a document which we redacted locally, on which we do own the copyright, so I strongly feel we should be allowed to copy it into a local text file. Why does firefox allow google docs to deprive us of our own intellectual property in such a way?

However, many websites (Twitter is currently a random example) offer HTTPS but do not set the "secure" flag in their authentication cookies.  That means that a network attacker (like Firesheep combined with a malicious website, or like Firesheep but with the addition of an easy-to-implement active attack) can steal the user's authentication cookies and hijack their account simply by causing the browser to GET something from the http:// version of the victim domain.  The network attacker will get the cookie before the webserver ever has a chance to respond/redirect the user to HTTPS.  There are solutions to this, of course: set the secure flag in all authentication cookies, or better, enable HSTS since that also protects against SSL stripping attacks.  The web browser needs to indicate to users (and web developers) if these security problems exist in HTTPS websites.  Break the lock icon, change the colour of the address bar, cross out the "https", whatever is considered fashionable these days.  An HTTPS website with insecure cookies is not really secure.

I believe that the same (?????) happens if you try to paste the text from it to a regular OS/2 application such as e.exe. Obviously, Greek symbols cannot be represented in your 8-bit code page so Java (Odin) inserts them to the clipboard using a custom Unicode clipboard format but FF seems to prefer the standard 8-bit CF_TEXT format (that cannot represent these symbols and contains ?????) instead of the custom Unicode format, while OOo prefers the latter and therefore works.

About a week is enough for the bug to trigger.  You can only see that it triggered when you finally notice that the lists of Recently closed tabs and windows cannot be cleared anymore using the "remove all history" pannel (CTRL+SHIFT+SUPPR), even with all options selected.  The only way I found to wipe these two lists is to delete the entire session.  Expected behaviour: The user has a session opened with many tabs and Panorama tab groups. He is privacy concious though, and he frequently deletes his tracks using CTRL+SHIFT+SUPPR. This includes all history and previous navigation, however he did kept all these tabs opens, which means he does not want them deleted; He wants their URLs to keep being stored in sessionstore.js along with their order, the tab group they belong to as well as their window. By keeping these tabs open while clearing all history, he expects ALL data to be erased, of any kind, except what is stated above.   Recently closed tabs and windows, also stored within sessionstore.js, stops being erased after the bug occur and until the session is just wiped entirely.   (Eventual bug that is unrelated: Panorama's cache can't seem to be cleared with regular cache (?) )   Finally, I don't know what triggers this bug. For information, I have cache and history disabled and only rely on the "recently closed ___" list to get back to lost tabs. I set it so that 30+ tabs are remembered (default is 10) and 6 windows (default is 3).  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Keep using the same session for a week or so 2.

In this situation, it would be extremely useful if individual window titles could be dragged out (perhaps into a separate Firefox instance, or into a mail composition window) and the URL could be obtained by right-clicking.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Visit about:sessionrestore 2. Attempt to copy or drag individual tab titles   Actual Results:   None  Expected Results:   Dragging a tab title into another browser window should open the corresponding page in that browser window.  Dragging a tab title into some other context should paste the corresponding URL into the drag destination.  Right-clicking a tab title should offer a context menu with "Copy URL" (and perhaps "Open in a new window" etc)  I'm reluctant to suggest that the tab titles should be actual links, because that would make it too easy to accidentally navigate away from the sessionrestore context.  But it should be possible to extract the URLs for individual tabs, for example for pasting into a bug report like this one.  Power users can certainly reason about how this is implemented and discover the sessionstore.js file, and copy+paste out of that, but this is at best a cumbersome and clumsy workaround for the masochistic elite.|2011-06-22T07:28:05Z

672607|Clash between Ctrl-a to "highlight all matches" in find-in-page and OSX's move cursor to start of line|x86|Keyboard Navigation|2011-07-19T19:39:02Z|||On OSX, all textarea's and input elements have unix-/emacs-style keybindings, eg Ctrl-e moves the cursor to the end of the line, Ctrl-delete removes the previous word of input, and Ctrl-a moves the cursor to the start of the line.  However, if the find-in-page bar is open, Ctrl-a toggles the "highlight all matches" option. This is fine, but when the find-in-page bar has been open for ten minutes since you last searched for something (because it doesn't automatically close) it can be *very* annoying to press Ctrl-a and not have the cursor move to the beginning of the line.  How can we consolidate the "highlight all" behavior with the move to start of line behavior? I suggest that Ctrl-a should only "highlight all" if the find-in-page bar has focus, and otherwise should let OSX do its normal start of line thing.|2011-07-19T19:39:02Z

(The number doesn't seem to matter; in my current instance, I have 4 open.  It also seems independent of safe mode.) 2) Minimize Firefox. 3) Put the laptop to sleep 4) Wake up the laptop, and restore the Firefox window   Actual results:  Firefox displays a completely white screen -- neither the Firefox title/tabbar with the Firefox menu and min/max/close buttons, nor the Win7 default titlebar -- for several seconds.  It seemed stuck that way, and when I wiggled my mouse I think I moved it over a link (I couldn't tell, because it was all white...).  the mouse cursor changed shape, and a moment or two later, the Firefox UI and the web content came back.   Expected results:  Firefox shouldn't hang or white-out the screen.  I think this definitely has to do with how Windows handles minimized windows differently than non-minimized ones -- the live preview, for instance, doesn't stay live for minimized windows.  It's possible that because Firefox has some custom painting logic for the titlebar, Windows doesn't cache the previous contents of the window, especially after a sleep/wakeup.|2011-08-09T18:56:47Z

That string comes from the OS, not    from us. 2)  The MP3 thing... again that information about QuickTime comes from    the OS.  The issue is that OSX has two different sources of MIME information, as far as I can tell, and that the interaction of the two is entirely undocumented.  Sometimes the OS uses one, sometimes the other, sometimes both.  We try to make sense of it as much as we can, but I can readily believe there are cases where we pick the wrong source....  If you have any apple contacts who happen to know how this stuff actually works, I'm all ears. __________________________  Here's the reply from an Apple engineer:  Here are the selection criteria for LaunchServices, from http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/DOCUMENTATION/Carbon/Conceptual/LaunchServicesConcepts/LSCConcepts/LSCConcepts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000999-CH202-BABBJJEF:  > Preferred Application for a Document > For individual document files (whether specified by a file-system reference or a URL with scheme file), the criteria are as follows: > > 1. If the user has specified an explicit binding for the document (or for the entire document type to which it belongs), the preferred application is the one the user has specified. > 2. If the document has a filename extension (or if one has been specified as a parameter to LSGetApplicationForInfo), find all applications in the Launch Services database that claim to accept documents with that extension. > 3. If the document carries a four-character file type (or if one has been specified as a parameter), find all applications that claim to accept files of that type. > 4. If more than one application has been found as a result of steps 2–3, apply the following criteria in the order shown: > a. If the document carries a four-character creator signature (or if one has been specified as a parameter), give preference to any application that claims to accept documents with that signature (typically the application to which the signature belongs). > b. Give preference to native OS X applications over those that run in the Classic emulation environment. > c. Give preference to applications residing on the boot volume over those residing on other file-system volumes. > d. Give preference to applications residing on a local volume over those residing on a remote volume. > e. If two or more versions of the same application have been found, give preference to the one with the latest version number.   I'm betting the reason StuffIt Expander shows up as the owner for a ZIP file is because that's preloaded into Mac OS X's MIME type database as the preferred handler for a ZIP file. But in reality, when you open one, it gets handled by Archive Utility. The LSGetApplicationForItem() and LSGetApplicationForURL() methods should return this information for you.  (It's worth noting that LaunchServices no longer considers the four-character creator code on Snow Leopard and later.)|2011-09-18T23:57:54Z

If I click on one of them them, I see the correct URL in the URL bar, but it doesn't load (I have 'browser.sessionstore.restore_on_demand' set to true, so I would expect the tab to load at this point.) I'm attaching a screenshot of the tabs drop down menu.  I don't recall when I first saw this problem, but it was a few weeks ago. It seems to mostly occur when Firefox doesn't shut down properly (which is why I first attributed it to that.)

Actual results:  In certain cases the really long ones will generate a file dialog, indicating that it flat out *won't* save at all. However, in a few cases, the name seems to be within a range of sizes that somehow Firefox fails to recognize as invalid, at which point you get one of two results - 1. It seems to save, but doesn't. 2. It does save, but you can't view, open, or edit, the resulting file, and worse, the only way to remove them, once they exist, is via the Windows console, since they can't be dragged, deleted, right click deleted, or anything else.   Expected results:  Attempting to save the file should have produced a dialog window, as normal, indicating that the file can't be saved. A file should never be saved, even if the OS allows it, which is how ever many characters more than is safe, since this leaves unusable files on the system, and possibly creates other problems, in other applications.  I understand a similar issue existed in the MAC branch, but.. the file I found recently with this problem was, I am fairly certain, saved since upgrading to 7, so, unless I am mistaken about when I saved the file, (I have already deleted it, so can't check the date), the problem may still be present in the Windows branch.|2011-10-21T23:27:07Z

The flash widget makes network requests, the result of which get cached to disk.   Actual results:  Generating temporary files performs a linear search for available filenames, which can create significant UI lag when there are enough files.   Expected results:  Temporary files should have more-unique filenames at initial generation, so that a search does not take very long to find an available filename.  There is a patch attached that should fix it.|2011-11-22T23:15:20Z

706988|file download workflow breaks if triggered from an iframe which gets removed inbetween|All|File Handling|2011-12-01T22:38:08Z|||This might be a invalid bug as I don't know if the following is supposed to work at all.  A JS webapp is providing a download functionality for documents and to achieve this it uses the following jQuery (should not matter) code:  var iframe = $("<iframe/>", { src: FILE_URL }).css({    some, css  }).one("load", function (e) {   setTimeout(function () {     iframe.remove();   }, 10); }).appendTo(document.body);  So what Firefox does by default is to offer the dialog to "open" or "save" the file. Once the user choose "save" the dialog closes and no filechooser is coming up.  When I increase the timeout so I can actually open the save dialog before it times out it works fine.  As said I cannot tell if the webapp is allowed to do that but at least IE9 and Chrome can open a filedialog and download the file.|2011-12-01T22:38:08Z

I've talked about this bug with the author of Palemoon (www.palemoon.org). This is (for those who don't know it) a browser which is much like firefox. The author of palemoon thinks the memory leak is a bug within firefox, and therefore requested me to fill a bug report on this website. See our discussion at http://forum.palemoon.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=348   Actual results:  The memory usage of both palemoon and firefox goes beyond every limit. Usually at the end of the day, both browsers use about 3.0 gb of memory. A large part of this is caused by a js memory leak. About 1 gb of memory is used by my subsonic media streamer (see www.subsonic.org). Another 1 gb is used by 'a pool of memory for wich use is unspecified'.   Since Palemoon is my standard browser, i've installed the latest Firefox this morning. I've set all my plugins, extensions, bookmarks, general settings, etc to be the same as with palemoon. I've copiëd a session file to my firefox profile folder and opened it. In this session are all my frequently used tabs including Subsonic.  I've started both browsers at the same time. I use palemoon, and firefox just sits there with 37 tabs open. These browsers are now battling with each other. Wich one can use the most amount of memory? Currently the fresh firefox install is winning the battle with over 1.8 gb of allocated memory. See the attachment for more information.  Also see these images for the memory usage of palemoon this week:  http://piclair.com/data/abrer.jpg http://piclair.com/data/84802.jpg   Expected results:  I do not expect both browsers to use more than 1 gb of memory.|2011-12-13T18:44:51Z

Sometimes and seemingly in no regular pattern (according to the prefixes or original filenames) the textbox just marks the whole filename on pressing enter instead of the dialogue saving the file.

After the installation, Firefox tried to display the web pages that were open before the installation but it failed to correctly open this website. I tried to duplicate the problem by terminating the firefox.exe process from Task Manager but the problem seems to happen only when updating Firefox.  I am the one who created the Red Goblin web site (back in 2008) and I am seeing these JavaScript exceptions (sent back through AJAX) for a few Firefox users. Today, I finally managed to reproduce it.  The website is built as an web application so the user stays on a single web page for the entire duration of the visit. There are some elements that are loaded through AJAX, but there's a big chunk of data that is needed from the server and the website gets it by sending a POST request in an IFRAME. The IFRAME then sends the data to the page on the ONLOAD event.  When loading the page after upgrading Firefox, the browser doesn't perform the POST request for the IFRAME like it normally does.   Actual results:  the website should have been loaded like it normally does when visiting the website in Firefox   Expected results:  After upgrading, Firefox should load the already opened websites using the usual loading sequence and not skip some of the steps in loading them.|2012-02-13T06:45:52Z

There are two issues with this:  1. spiegel.de is displayed as a blank page, which makes sense, since it always only redirects to www.spiegel.de  2. Having the urls next to each other provides no benefit whatsoever and takes away the space that could be used by other pages. From my top 9 pages, 3 are blank redirects.  It can be tricky to figure out which one to display, the plain one or the one with www. I have daringfireball.net in my top list, but that redirects from wwww.daringfireball.net to firefball.net.

737804|Implement regular/periodic/automatic background migration, replacing the wizard with a simple dialog asking what types of data to import|All|Migration|2012-03-21T11:14:06Z|[ux]||For most new users (those who only have one browser installed other than their new fox), migration could be done silently, with no wizard involved whatsoever. It seems Chrome takes this understanding a step further, and always imports from the default browser even if there's few browser installed.  However, in Chrome, it's much easier to later tweak your migration needs (see bug 731144).  On top of that, it seems there's no need for the multiple-step-wizard, even if migration is not done silently.  The simple dialog in Chrome seems to work pretty well.  Our wizard has this extra step of dealing with the homepage setting, but it seems that the now-fully-functional about:home and about:newtab pages make it a clear cut: the homepage shouldn't be imported, at least not during first-time migration.  We could, instead, import the homepage as a bookmark.  ____ Technical note: this blocks bug 718280 due to implementation details.

Now I can find no way for a user to edit their cookies without knowing SQL and possessing SQL tools.  Which, since cookies aren't inherently SQL databases, doesn't seem to me should be necessary.  I propose adding back some modicum of user-editability to cookies.  Two ways I can think of are:  1.  Restore some cookies.txt-like functionality.  For example, add buttons (somewhere) "Export Cookies to Text File" and "Import Cookies from Text File".  2.  Restore some Cookie Manager-like functionality.  For example, add buttons to the Cookies window "New Cookie", "Copy Cookies", "Paste Cookies", and "Edit Cookie".|2012-05-19T18:45:29Z

This means that the address of an already opened page in a different tab is silently modified.   For now the only site I know this to happen is at amazon.de, but the problem is always reproducible with a clean profile of Firefox.   The author of TabMixPlus yet confirmed confirmed the issue, please see http://tmp.garyr.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=16341 (quoting: "This is not a Tabmix issue.

You should notice that the last clicked image (expected to open in the first tab) opens in the SECOND tab instead, whereas nothing happens in the FIRST tab (where the mouse event originally was triggered).

763806|allow social providers to specify less-intrusive "shrunken sidebars"|All|SocialAPI|2012-06-12T02:25:57Z|[needs-api-change]||Part of our goal in implementing Facebook's sidebar is to allow users to continue their Firefox browsing while being in touch with their social circle.  In this way, Facebook is available and scannable, but also ignorable.  Of course, if a user wants to focus, they can temporarily hide the Facebook sidebar.  But what if they're still having a conversation with a Facebook contact?  What if that conversation is part of their browsing task?  For instance, say a user wanted to pick a restaurant eat at with a friend.  They would want to continue talking to that friend while browsing restaurant websites, but the other information in their social feed would be irrelevant and possibly distracting.  The attached mockup shows a smaller, shrunken state of the Facebook sidebar.  All but contacts' avatars and active conversations are hidden.  There's other reasons than distraction to allow users an option halfway between the full Facebook sidebar and no sidebar at all.  Contact names and contact notifications represent deeply personal data.  Any one contact could be a very private part of a person's life.  Any notification could contain private information, profanity, or other data that users may not want to have visible at all times.  By giving users the ability to shrink their bar to just their contacts' faces, we're allowing them to continue browsing with more screen real estate and continue conversations while disengaging from the more frenzied slew of information in their social feed.  With names hidden, potentially private data is less likely to be glimpsed by a passer-by.  But, functionality isn't highly reduced: users are likely to recognize the contacts they converse with.  If an avatar is unfamiliar, the user can mouse over it for the contacts' full name.|2012-06-12T02:25:57Z

Repeat this for different tabs, and (IMPORTANT!) hover your mouse over a preview of a tab from another tab group. For example, active tab group is called A, and there is another tab group called B. Each has 2 tabs. In the Aero Peak there will be all 4 tabs. Hover any tab from *hidden* tab group B. Firefox will bring that tab to front. - Without clicking on any tab preview from Aero Peak, move the mouse away from the taskbar, leaving the same active tab in Firefox -> after the hidden tab was brought to front due to Aero Peak hovering, when the active tab is brought again to front its content is blank. You need to select another tab then come back in order to see the content again.   Actual results:  When hovering a tab preview corresponding to a hidden tab (from an inactive tab group) through the Windows 7 Aero Peak feature, Firefox will bring that hidden tab to front, even if it is part of an inactive (hidden) tab group. That tab will remain in Firefox tab bar until any other tab is selected.  After moving the mouse away from Aero Peak previews (without clicking on any of it) Firefox will return to the original active tab which was initially selected, but its content is shown as blank, no matter what page was loaded. You need to select another tab then come back to see the content again.   Expected results:  Either do not show the tab previous from hidden tab groups in the Aero Peak (bug 627895) OR correct the behaviour described above.|2012-06-14T07:30:16Z

I had only one Window. When Firefox was trying to close, two plugin containers were not closing down, so I force closed them. After waiting for quite a while, the main Firefox application still did not close down, so I force closed it as well. After that I started Firefox again.   Actual results:  Firefox went through the upgrade process and upgraded to version 13.0.1. When Firefox opened, all the tabs were gone and it opened a brand new tab welcoming to new Firefox. I quickly looked up about the session and found out that there is a backup copy, so I saved that. If I would not have saved the backup copy on time and restarted Firefox, I could have lost everything. After closing Firefox and renaming the backup session file to a regular file name multiple times, Firefox did not even offer to restore my previous session, it was opening the same one tab. Then I manually looked through the session file and saw that "window" did not have any entries, but "_closed_window" has all of my tab information. So I manipulated the file by swapping the names between window and closed window. Started Firefox and regained my tabs (I also noticed that for some reason Firefox opened two other windows with one tab in each with some site that I visited a long time ago).   Expected results:  I expected Firefox to recover my old session and bring up all my tabs. I would prefer that Firefox retains multiple session backups, with control by the user on how many and their retention period. I normally used TabMixPlus for session management and it gave me that feature, but I wanted to use Firefox' "don't load tabs until selected" feature.|2012-06-22T17:03:33Z

In those cases often (but not always) the Pinned AppTabs are lost upon recovery of the session.    Actual results:  They serve as my homepage, but are NOT included in the Options > Homepage box. Since I have about 20 of them pinned, it is a lot of work to re-enter all the home page websites one by one, pin them again.     Expected results:  Well, three things: 1. Firefox should not crash (that often)... 2. Upon a crash the Pinned AppTabs should be recovered if I use the session recovery feature 3. The Pinned AppTabs should also be mentioned in the Options > Homepage box, for easy reconstruction in case of unexpected trouble - and to copy/paste a long list of home page tabs into another computer (since sync can not do that)|2012-06-24T06:47:45Z

I save a copy of a web page (html only) in a location. I click a download link on that page and save the download in the same location.  I do this repeatedly, with web pages and downloads in pairs. The web page is a description of the download.   Actual results:  The location in the "Save as..." dialogue box defaults to the last location used. This is regular for saving the web pages. For the download, however, sometimes the default is the last location used for saving a web page and sometimes it is the one for saving a download.  The default behaviour is erratic, so that I have to double-check. Where the save location has defaulted to the last used for a download, not a web page, I have to scroll and click to change that.   Expected results:  The location for saving the download should default to the last location used for saving either a web page or a download, whichever is the case.|2012-07-05T16:58:35Z

Actual results:  Every 10 sec, FF saves the session, which causes freezes.  FF has been on for some days now, and I have multiple tabs open.   Expected results:  Should not have lagged.  I'm not involved in the source code and not really sure what's stored. But wouldn't it be better if the session storing is done on events? That is, the small changes only saved when changes occurs or saved every X seconds IF any changes had been done?  Watching an YT-video does not change anything afaik, so I don't see the necessity of the cause of the lag (storing the session).  I'm not involved, but if it is what I think it is, it looks somewhat clumsy.  :)|2012-07-16T03:02:56Z

I saw the same problem in Opera 11.x before, with the difference that in Opera at least if the certificate fails or loads partially in a web page (resulting in non-encrypted or partially encrypted connection, a security issue) it advice you. Firefox does not have something like this.   However, in previous versions certified/encrypted sites that doesn't supports TLS was marked as a blue tag in the address bar (green for "all ok" sites). And if happens the related issue about encryption/certificate, Firefox does not show it, being this a warning sign.  In Firefox 14, encryption symbol looks grey, making confusion about certificate or encryption status if the related issue happens. It's good to remember that a vulnerability was discovered time ago with TLS and these sites (like Facebook or Yahoo! login page, for example) turned off the TLS support for security reasons.   An alert in the baloon text (like Opera) and a distinctive color instead of grey lock for encrypted sites (like blue, used by older versions of Firefox) would be well appreciated.|2012-07-18T19:50:29Z

776303|Kernel panic during Firefox shutdown on Retina Macbook|x86|Shell Integration|2012-07-22T01:16:39Z|||This may be difficult to reproduce, but logging to keep the record:  Firefox 14.0.1, on a brand-new Macbook Pro "Retina".  MacOS 10.7.4, which includes the driver patch release in the week of July 15 2012.  Firefox had been running for some time.  It is quite likely that the graphics hardware had switched between the GeForce and the Intel HD during the lifetime of the firefox process since I had run several games.  It is equally likely that Flash had run on numerous pages.  Two app tabs and 13 normal tabs were open.  I installed an addon (Pocket), navigated to the Extensions tab of the add-on manager, and clicked "Restart Now".  After a pause of approximately a second, the kernel panic screen was displayed.  I suspect that something in the teardown logic ran into some bad state in the display drivers; I speculate that the mode-switching caused by running 3D-accelerated games during the lifecycle of the firefox process could be a factor.

Actual results:  Very often when I open a folder on the bookmarks toolbar and try to open a bookmark when there are enough items to cause the list of items to scroll the scroll will get stuck scrolling until I mouse over the opposite direction arrow. And even then it will often get stuck scrolling in the opposite direction. Extremely, extremely annoying. I don't know if its because my mouse moves too fast over them or what but I really can't stand it anymore and am at the point where I either have to figure out a way to fix it or switch browsers.

After successfully setting it up I was browsing and trying to bookmark a page *and* create a new folder for that bookmark, as well.    Actual results:  Upon clicking the "New Folder" button when saving the bookmark the user is given only a second or two to name the folder, before it is abruptly cut off and the resulting folder mislabeled.   Expected results:  Renaming the folder should not have a time limit imposed on it, and if it does, that time limit should be at least 30 seconds to a minute.  Firefox Sync has been determined to be the cause of the problem, because if it is disabled, this issue no longer arises.  I have confirmed this to effect 2 installations of firefox that are linked via Firefox Sync.  One is a desktop running Windows 7 64-bit, the other a laptop running Windows 7 32-bit.

Further, this is a bit of a foot-gun, much like the one in bug 787511 - there is no indication in the name that 'getWorker()' is actually returning a shared port, so someone using getWorker().port.onmessage may well be shooting other attempted message handlers for the port.

788465|Reload icon from Linux system icon theme is inappropriate for AwesomeBar|All|Theme|2012-09-05T11:40:24Z|||One of the implicit considerations for choosing an icon from a user-customizable theme must be its intended context. However, the "reload" icon Firefox hass been using in the AwesomeBar since somewhere around Firefox 9 or Firefox 10 is designed with the assumption that it will be used in *toolbar* buttons.  That means that, in many system icon themes (including the Elementary theme Lubuntu uses by default), it looks ill-fitted and out-of-place compared to the bundled reload icon used in Windows. (Typically, because toolbar icons are expected to be more detailed, more colourful, and colour-coordinated to match a background color other than white)  As, to the best of my knowledge, the system icon theme does not generally contain an icon for this context, I suggest reverting to the bundled single-color icon but resolving it via the theming system's facility for custom lookup paths to preserve the ability for it to be overridden.|2012-09-05T11:40:24Z

This is used for styling to show new activity in the chat.  * If a collapsed chat with activity is shown using 'showChat' (which is (indirectly, via openChat) how a provider would show it), the 'activity' flag is removed from the chat but not the nub.  If the chat being shown is the only collapsed chat with activity, the attribute on the nub should also be removed.  * The popupshown event (when the nub's menu is displayed) removes the attribute from the nub.  It should only be removed when (a) the actual chat with activity is selected by the menu and (b) when no other collapsed chats also have activity.  Note that as the nub menu calls showChat the fix is: * Don't remove the attribute in popupshown * After showChat removes the attribute from the chat itself, have it count the remaining collapsed children with the attribute and update the attribute on the num accordingly  Shane - sound right to you?|2012-10-29T02:22:49Z

For example: If I set "ui.key.contentAccess" to 5 (default in windows), when I press Ctrl+Shift, a tooltip should appear in the page, near each element showing which accesskeys exist according to which elements they exist.  My idea is that a tooltip that looks like the one created for the @title appears when pressing the keys configured are pressed.  Comments are welcome.|2012-12-24T15:06:53Z
826742|nsExternalHelperAppService.cpp : Assertion: Empty aExtension parameter! (from DEBUG BUILD of TB)|All|File Handling|2013-01-04T17:14:08Z|||Created attachment 697947 nsExternalHelperAppService.cpp  While testing thunderbird (debug build of comm-central source) by running "make mozmill" locally, I noticed many ASSERTION messages.  Among them is an assertion message from nsExternalHelperAppSErvice.cpp.  From the cursory reading, I think the message comes from a function to to find a proper helper application based on file extension (a la ".ppt", ".ps", etc. [not sure if "." is in the extension] )  The code is printing ASSERTION when such extension passed from the caller is empty (because, I assume, such extension is non-existent for a particular file name: i.e., "abc" vs "abc.ppt")  Such file names do exist and often are handed to us by some web services, for example. (Usually the additional proper mime type, etc. during downloading helps us in finding the appropriate helper application.  So, although not getting the extension such as "ppt", or "ps" is unlucky, but it is not fatal at all.  Just as the code does today, simply returning without finding a matching application silently is enough.  So I suggest that we remove NS_ASSERTION() statement.  I am proposing this change to remove noise from the session log of "make mozmill" test run of DEBUG BUILD of TB.|2013-01-04T17:14:08Z

841495|implement background service for page thumbnailing|All|General|2013-02-14T20:44:44Z|||The goal is to address bug 756881 by allowing us to take snapshots of sites loaded without cookies (i.e. load the page with nsIRequest::LOAD_ANONYMOUS), and to eventually also potentially address bug 755996, by avoiding thumbnailing pages that contain e.g. filled in form data.  A nice side effect is that we may be able to have this process occur entirely off the main thread, such that the thumbnailing process in general does not cause main thread responsiveness issues.

844038|Filename detect after Content-Disposition decode as utf8 fail in Linux|x86_64|File Handling|2013-02-22T11:42:07Z|||Created attachment 717049 curl command stdout output dump  I am using Linux, sometime I click a link to download a file, Firefox display a wrong filename.  The web page render correctly, and hover the mouse on the link, status bar display filename also right. The filename si wrong in download dialog, and in file system after save it.  But downlod the same file on Windows XP, Firefox for Windows don't have this problem, the filename is right. After google, Firefox for Mac also have this problem.  Chrome the same as Firefox, alright on Windows, but wrong on Linux.  ---  After a deep test I found out what cause this problem, because the server return the http header Content-Disposition.  I alway can reproduce this problem with the server hfs http://www.rejetto.com/hfs/   hfs is popular http file sharing server on Windows, it return utf-8 encoded index html, but unfortunately, when download a file, the filename in Content-Disposition is not utf-8 encoding but the system default, in my case, Simplified Chinese Windows XP, the default encoding is GB18030(or GB23 12, GBK, they are compatible).  I run XP in virtual machine, the share a file with hfs      * ip is 192.168.0.101     * correct filename is "测试.7z", English word "test".     * "测试" GBK encoded characters is '\xb2\xe2\xca\xd4', test in python shell `u'测试'.encode('GBK')`.  In my host system, Fedora Linux, shell terminal using utf-8 encoding to display text.  I run:      $ curl -i 'http://192.168.0.101/测试.7z'     HTTP/1.1 200 OK     Content-Type: application/octet-stream     Content-Length: 0     Accept-Ranges: bytes     Server: HFS 2.2f     Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="????.7z";     Last-Modified: Fri, 22 Feb 2013 09:18:33 GMT  Note "????.7z", question mark, because terminal can't display it.  I use xxd to see the filename string hex      0000090: 656e 743b 2066 696c 656e 616d 653d 22b2  ent; filename=".     00000a0: e2ca d42e 377a 223b 0d0a 4c61 7374 2d4d  ....7z";..Last-M  "b2e2cad4", actually hfs encoding it in GBK, and in this format, it should be utf-8.  I upload the curl command dump as attechment, use nc command to run fake http server.      $curl -i 'http://192.168.0.101/测试.7z' > httpdump     $ nc -l 8000 < httpdump  So you can test it easily.  ---  After google, I found Content-Disposition format is messy: http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/  It look like relate this testcase: http://greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/#attwithutf8fnplain  But why Firefox for Windows don't have this problem in this case? So I still think is a bug.  Maybe Firefox can use system default encoding as fallback, My Linux default encoding(env LANG) is en_US.UTF-8, still is utf-8, still fail. But XP is zh_CN.GB18030, so Firefox can decode it correctly.  So, I run Firefox on Linux with      $ LANG=zh_CN.GB18030 firefox  Test it again, this time download dialog can display file correctly, and also right in download panel, but on file system, it still "????.7z", and nautilus file manager warn it "invalid encoding".  I run another Windows XP in virtual machine, Change the system language/region in Control Panle to "China Taiwan", which encoding is "zh_TW.BIG5", then use Firefox download the file again, this time, Firefox also display a wrong name.  So it look like Firefox actually try to decode the filename with system default encoding. But utf-8 is recommend to Linux/Mac.   Of course, server developer should follow the web standard to use utf-8, but still many website only service for local region users, they don't care what Linux/Mac/UTF-8 is.  It is annoying, I suggest Firefox can provide a fallback encodings settings in about:config, something like "download.filename.fallback_encodings", let Linux/Mac user edit it when they need.  Chrome also fail in this case, but look like it's fallback is extract a filename from the url, in some case it just display "download".|2013-02-22T11:42:07Z

858448|Stop loading process of tab that was opened by link with target="_blank" will lose the URL|All|Address Bar|2013-04-05T08:16:55Z|[dupeme]||Created attachment 733768 Test case  Links without target="_blank" attribute is OK. But for links with target="_blank", things are slightly different.  Reproduce steps (you can use the test case page in attachment): 1. Open some link with target="_blank" in new tab 2. Switch to the tab, if the link load very slow, you may want to stop wasting time, so let us stop it by hit the stop button.  After stopped the slow loading, you may want to copy/sent the link to your friend or network administrator to ask why this link load so slow But it's impossible, the link is lost, only about:blank or nothing left in your location bar    If you open link (B) from parent site (A) with target="_blank", firefox will NOT remember the browse session of (B), so you cannot get the url of site (B) if you closed it after you click the link (A).   Thus, for those who prefer open a lot of tabs when they browsing, they're very likely encountered such situation: some tabs of theirs load very slow, so they stopped those, but result in many blank tabs without any useful URL.  If they forgot where those tabs are from (don't forget that they usually open a LOT of tabs, so this is very likely to happen), they can never know what those tabs were, for what, important or not.   The test page offered in the attachment can generate two links of given URL (you entered in the input area, don't forget including http://), one with target="_blank" and one without. You can choose a link that is slow loading for you or you don't have enough time to stop it before the loading complete.  The gif animation image offered in the attachment was captured on my own machine. You may noticed that link without target="_blank" is loading slower than the other one, I don't know why.|2013-04-05T08:16:55Z

873377|social.reload-worker has a race issue with reloading sidebars|x86_64|SocialAPI|2013-05-17T07:26:51Z|||I'm not sure that I can safely use the 'social.reload-worker' function without breaking any currently loaded sidebar. When the worker reloads all the connections with the sidebar are lost (the port is closed). To remedy this I thought I'd either reload the sidebars, or tell them to reconnect, but there is no appropriate order in which that can be done safely.  If I tell the sidebars to reload they will reload, but I can't control the order of that reload with respect to the worker reload. So I have no idea if they'll form an appropriate connection to the worker. The same thing happens if I merely send a message telling the sidebars to reload.  Now, the work also can't fix the problem since it can't discover workers. It relies on the initial connection messages to even know a sidebar exists. Thus when it reloads it has no knowledge of the existing sidebars.  As the 'social.reload-worker' is specified now I don't see any method by which I could alleviate potential race conditions. In my quick tests I happen to get the right loading order, but there's nothing guaranteeing that. It would be better if I 'reload' would actually restart the provider completely, including the sidebars.|2013-05-17T07:26:51Z

I am a web designer and I just upgraded from XP to 8 and first overall problem I had was ClearType in the entire OS. So I disabled ClearType in the Windows 8 Control Panel settings and I also deselected 'Smooth edges of screen fonts' from Visual Effects tab and noticed that the later one disables antialiasing/smoothing/ClearType for web fonts on Firefox. Which means it renders all fonts, default and web fonts without any smoothing/antialiasing effect, which is bad. Default fonts should be rendered as sharp fonts and web fonts should be rendered as they supposed to be (with antialiasing effect). I cannot enable that setting in the Windows options just for that, because it enables smooth effect on the entire OS and it kills me. Windows XP doesn't have that ClearType crap and it all works fine, why can't they do the same with 8?  Also my about:config setting gfx.font_rendering.cleartype.use_for_downloadable_fonts is set to true which I suppose means that it should render web fonts with antialiasing cleartype effect.  I am using Firefox 21.0 with Windows 8 Pro x64.   Actual results:  ClearType do not work for web fonts. Windows settings overrides Firefox.   Expected results:  Web fonts should be rendered with ClearType as set in the about:config options.|2013-05-20T17:23:42Z

The site contains several files with the ability to navigate between files and within each file the ability to go to various pages (IF one presses the button to go to page 5 one goes to page 5. If one wants to return to the TOC page clicking on that TOC button takes on back to the index). On Explorer and on Chrome all the navigation works well.   Actual results:  On Firefox the navigation between files works just fine.  But within a file (kinetics or stoch) if one clicks page five one goes to page 4, ie clicking on page n takes you to page n-1. Clicking on the TOC buttons take you to the page above the index page again n-1. So in Firefox but not in Explorer or Chrome the paging is off by one page! So something strange must be happening with the Firefox indexing.   Expected results:  I would think that the Firefox brouser should work in the same way as the other two. Suspect that there is an indexing command in Firefox that is wrong.  You can access the web site "weseeco.org/courses" and see for yourself. Note (1) on the router page only the kinetics and stoch buttons are presently active. (2) In the kinetics and stoch modules only the buttons on the bottom of  the blue title page take you back to the router. The index with all of the page buttons is placed on the second screen. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I do not know what version i have, could not find it anyplace!|2013-05-21T15:59:40Z

882485|Add API keys support for Google Location Service API.|All|General|2013-06-12T23:32:05Z|||+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #835890 +++  Folks at Google have asked us to investigate using specific API keys for making requests to Google APIs from Firefox release builds. The goal is to allow them to put further restrictions on non-Firefox uses of those APIs.  Some preliminary information about how this works in Chrome: > This is the link for contributors outside of Google: > http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/api-keys >  > The key implementation files in the Chromium source tree are: >  > a) A central point for retrieving the API key and OAuth2 tokens that > are set on the build. This picks up the key and tokens that are baked > in via preprocessor defines or in an internal-only header file, and > bakes them into the binary. It also allows overriding values at > runtime via environment variables and command-line switches. See > http://code.google.com/p/chromium/source/search?q=google_api_keys.h > and its associated .cc file. >  > b) A build configuration that detects whether the > google_chrome_api_keys.h file is available and uses it automatically > if it is, depending on configuration. See > http://code.google.com/p/chromium/source/search?q=common%5C.gypi+google_api > (top result) and a Python script it depends on, > http://code.google.com/p/chromium/source/search?q=build/check_internal%5C.py    This is a requirement of the current GLS contract -- without sending keys, we can not do Geolocation.|2013-06-12T23:32:05Z

In the first attempt, I just ran the installer.  The default directory was an insecure location inside my Windows Profile.  I tried to override that to the existing location (c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla\Firefox).  But the installer said I didn't have rights and didn't attempt to elevate the process.  So I reran the installer, this time as the administrator.  This time the path was the location where I had FF 21.  But again, it claimed I didn't have rights.  So I then opened FF 21 and tried to upgrade from Help/About.  That worked.   Actual results:  Firefox's installer for version 22 claimed I didn't have rights.   Expected results:  1. If Firefox is already installed, that location should be the default location regardless.  2. Ask if the user prefers the insecure location (and label it as such) or a location in Program Files or Program Files (x86) and mention those are protected by UAC.  As needed, add the location where Firefox is already installed.  3. If the user picks a location protected by UAC, attempt to elevate the process.|2013-06-26T00:14:51Z

894424|Even with domain guessing off, address bar flashes guessed domain|x86_64|Address Bar|2013-07-16T15:36:58Z|||User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:22.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/22.0 (Beta/Release) Build ID: 20130618035212  Steps to reproduce:  1. Turn off domain guessing as per http://www-archive.mozilla.org/docs/end-user/domain-guessing.html - i.e. set:  browser.fixup.alternate.enabled = false browser.fixup.alternate.prefix = an empty string browser.fixup.alternate.suffix = an empty string.  2. Into the address bar, enter a domain without the "www." prefix.  For example, "example.com".  This domain must serve content from http://example.com/ (i.e. not be a redirect.)  3. Press Enter.   Actual results:  The address bar changes from "example.com" (what the user entered) to "www.example.com" for a short period of time [1] and then changes to "example.com".  [1] I'm not sure what the "short period of time" is exactly.  Is it until a connection is made with the server?  Until the first byte is received?  Until the page is rendered?  etc.  I don't know.   Expected results:  The address bar should not change from "example.com".  Additional notes:  It *doesn't* appear to be the case that Firefox changes the address bar to www.example.com, then loads www.example.com, encounters a redirect to example.com, then changes the address bar to example.com.  At least, using the "Live HTTP Headers" add-on, Firefox never requests www.example.com, and only requests example.com (what the user entered.)  So this appears to be some UI weirdness, rather than e.g. not respecting the user's domain guessing settings.|2013-07-16T15:36:58Z

Power Mac late 2008, 8x2.8Ghz Intel Xeon. 16GB ram, 16 TB on 19 disks, 2+ TB free-space. 2 video cards [Radeon 5700, Radeon 2600], 3 1920x1080 monitors   Firefox takes 100% CPU on the main() thread after being active when Mac OS X  goes to sleep. After sleep, every UI interaction causes Firefox take 100% CPU for  5-30 seconds [open link in a new window, render a new page in a current window,  scroll down]. Restarting Firefox causes Firefox to take 100% CPU for 5+ minutes  after all windows are closed.   After restart or at first launch Firefox CPU is normal [10-30%].  This hang occurs with any recent version of Firefox [19.0 thru 25.0].

This bug is 100% reproducible.   Expected results:  Firefox CPU usage should be 10-30% with 20 open windows and no user interaction [all CPU usage should be in JavaScript code].|2013-07-28T17:36:32Z

925872|"Confirm Close" warning should include pinned tabs in its count (always on OSX and sometimes on Windows)|x86|Tabbed Browser|2013-10-11T19:18:47Z|||Created attachment 816023 OSX screen shot showing "Confirm close" prompt  See attached OSX screenshot which shows one pinned tab and two regular tabs open, and the "Confirm Close" dialog saying:    "You are about to close 2 tabs. Are you sure you want to continue?"  However, should you continue (again on OSX), you will ALWAYS loose all three tabs for good, so it seems more correct to say "You are about to close 3 tabs", because you are.  The reason you always loose all three tabs on OSX is that closing the Firefox window (which is when, and only when, this dialog comes up by the way), is distinct from closing the application process (Cmd+H or right-click+Quit). As such, this user action gets none of the cushy love historically attached to closing of the application, such as the explicit and optional (paraphrasing) "continue where I left off" or the implicit "preserve pinned tabs, because, you know, I pinned them".  OSX STR:  1. Open 3 tabs in Firefox and pin one of them.  2. Close the Firefox window with the red (x) in its corner.  3. See that the count of tabs-to-be-closed in the warning you get is 2.  4. Hit [Close tabs]  5. Open a new Firefox window and see that all tabs, pinned or not, are gone.  On Windows, the dialog is correct when you have one Firefox window, because closing the window also closes the application process, which lo and behold, activates the love and preserves your pinned tabs, which means they come back the next time you open a Firefox window, so it's as if they stuck to the window (ironically) and you never closed them, even though they went away temporarily with the window.  But if you have a second Firefox window open on Windows, then it is not clear which window will be preserved (only one can be saved). So in that case, closing a window may not give safe passage to its pinned tabs, and our dialog warning should include pinned tabs in its count.  WINDOWS STR A:  1. Open 3 tabs in Firefox and pin one of them.  2. Right-click on any link and chose "Open Link in New Window".  3. Close the first Firefox window with the red [x] in its corner.  4. See that the count of tabs-to-be-closed in the warning you get is 2.  5. Hit [Close tabs]  6. (Optional) close the second window.  7. Open a new Firefox window and see that all tabs, pinned or not, are gone.  An unfortunate side-effect of this is that you get no warning at all if all (or all but one) of your tabs are pinned, which means it behaves as if pinned tabs are worth less than regular tabs:  WINDOWS STR B - Extra pain:  1. Open 3 tabs in Firefox and pin TWO of them.  2. Right-click on any link and chose "Open Link in New Window".  3. Close the first Firefox window with the red [x] in its corner.  4. See that the window closes without any warning.  5. (Optional) close the second window.  6. Open a new Firefox window and see that all tabs in the first window, pinned or not, are gone.  The last STR shows that it is not just the number in the dialog that is wrong, but the number in the "user has multiple tabs"-calculation used to decide whether to bring up the dialog at all.  The setting of "Show my windows and tabs from last time" does not affect these STRs.|2013-10-11T19:18:47Z

This blank MIME type is causing nsExternalHelperAppService::GetFromTypeAndExtension() to return NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE, thus causing the _loadPluginHandlers() function in applications.js to fail.

Expected results:  While there is certainly a bug in the IBM Java 7 plugin - it should not report a blank MIME type, Firefox should be more resilient and handle this issue by simply skipping that MIME type and move on, populating the Applications list as normal except for the problem MIME type.

929038|(RFE) In Filesutils.jsm, incorporate a mapping function of I/O error code to a short English message.|All|File Handling|2013-10-21T17:28:06Z|||Created attachment 819842 nsIOErrorString() and its friends.  This proposal is based on what I found during the efforts to fix Bug 567585.  Short summary: Lack of proper error messages for many type of I/O errors.  Until January of 2013, I had tried to use nsIErrorService to catch the I/O errors returned during the saving of an attachment, and display sensible short error messages.  There are many I/O errors, familiar to programmers on POSIX systems, simply not handled by user-friendly application specific messages (defined in stringbundle) in thunderbird (and presumably firefox).  So I tried to find out how to print at least a short English message for this type of unhandled I/O errors.  A short English I/O message can be shown to sysadmin or to show to a newsgroup posting for advice, at least.  (Forget the localization. That can wait.)  My motto here is: A short English message should do in place of a comprehensive fix. It will reap a huge benefit for relatively small investment, and the programs can use such feature NOW.  General failure to obtain generic error message for various types of I/O errors that users encounter in real life is unfortunate.  To my chagrin, unfortunately, nsIErrorService, which I thought existed for this type of service, turned out to be not useful at all.  (The long and winding story is in the following: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mozilla.dev.platform/tydvqSacsUk/j01XeNiJW5MJ But please skip to the following.)  From : https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=567585#c85 by Gavin Sharp. --- quote --- As you've discovered, nsIErrorService is mostly not useful - nothing useful actually registers with the service, and there are no existing users, and so it's not really suitable for use here. We should really just remove it, since I don't think we're going to extend its use. I will file a separate bug on doing this. --- end quote ---  So eventually I am forced to create my own short routine to map an internally used I/O error code to a short English message.  I placed the work-in-progress patch with the said mapping function in https://bug567585.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=705863  From the same post by Gain Sharp mentioned above: --- quote --- This helper function seems useful, and would be good to put in a JS module. Maybe in FileUtils.jsm. --- end quote ---  The 'helper function' is the mapping function of I/O error code to short English message.  This is why I am posting this request here to consider the inclusion of the function mentioned below in Fileutils.jsm.  I am not blaming Gavin for this :-)  This is a proposal and so any hints/tips welcome. If Fileutils.jsm is not an appropriate target, suggest another one. This mapping function can be used to catch additional types of I/O errors and display useful error message by many routines, say,  e.g. Bug 928250 - TB3 fails to raise an error when it tries to save an attachment to write-protected directory.  Attached is the function. The file is created by quick cut&copy and editing and so may contain syntax errors and such. But at this stage, the idea is to get people to think about the merit of having such function in Fileutils.jsm.  I created the attached function in the following steps.  // // Bug 567585 had old discussion on this. // The description here is updated. // (The location of files and format change from time to time.) // comm-central/mozilla/xpcom/base/ErrorList.h has the following lines:    /* ======================================================================= */   /* 13: NS_ERROR_MODULE_FILES */   /* ======================================================================= */ #define MODULE NS_ERROR_MODULE_FILES   ERROR(NS_ERROR_FILE_UNRECOGNIZED_PATH,      FAILURE(1)),   ERROR(NS_ERROR_FILE_UNRESOLVABLE_SYMLINK,   FAILURE(2)),   ERROR(NS_ERROR_FILE_EXECUTION_FAILED,       FAILURE(3)),     ...   ERROR(NS_ERROR_FILE_ACCESS_DENIED,          FAILURE(21)),   Run the following command to obtain the template for the following code.  grep NS_ERROR_FILE mozilla/xpcom/base/ErrorList.h |  awk 'BEGIN { FS="[ ][ ]*"; } {printf("// case  %s : msg = \"%s\" ; break; \n", substr($3, 9, length($3)-11), substr(substr($2,1,length($2)-1),16));}'    // cf. The following command was suitable around Jan 2013. But no longer. // grep NS_ERROR_FILE mozilla/xpcom/base/ErrorList.h | awk '{printf("// case  %s : msg = \"%s\" ; break; \n", substr($2, 9, length($2)-11), substr(substr($1,1,length($1)-1),17));}'  From the above command, we  get output like the following:  // case  1 : msg = "FILE_UNRECOGNIZED_PATH" ; break;  // case  2 : msg = "FILE_UNRESOLVABLE_SYMLINK" ; break;  // case  3 : msg = "FILE_EXECUTION_FAILED" ; break;  //  ... // case  21 : msg = "FILE_ACCESS_DENIED" ; break;   Using the template I created the function mentioned above.  TIA  PS: If the proposal is generally considered OK, I will try to create a patch to Fileutils.jsm and then we can hammer out the details.|2013-10-21T17:28:06Z

During the fix, I noticed PR_Close() was not handled.  This can result in a data-loss error since PR_Close() can fail when the underlying system is a remote file system (CIFS and possibly NFS). I verified that a file mounted on a CIFS-share can cause PR_Close( basically  a wrapper for close()) to return EHOSTDOWN error when I simulated the network outage by disabling network interface of a VM (VMPlayer running on Win7 host) in which linux is running.  I am uploading a patch in the next post.  Before the patch, when the network is disconnected, and the local write buffer/cache is flushed to the remote server upon close(), the error is noticed. write() did not produce an error. So, without the patch to check for the error of PR_Close(), the user is led to believe that the file move/copy done by CopyToNative() is successful while it may not.  TIA|2013-11-11T04:59:45Z

Note the many use of PR_Close() without using the return value.  I filed a bug Bug 936987 - Catch and propagate PR_Close() error in CopyToNative()   but in doing so, I checked the usage of PR_Close() in comm-central, and found that there are many places where the return value of PR_Close() is ignored.  This is patently wrong as the bug that is fixed in Bug 936987 demonstrates.  There may be a lot once the system file system or network is causing PR_Close() to fail, but the user MUST BE MADE AWARE that an important I/O operation has failed, and possibly the written file is not in good state.

The latter is truncated by more open tabs; the former is not.  Open more than a handful of tabs, and you see this:     _______________________________________________________________    ° ° °    Amazon.com: Novelty Horse Head Mask Prop: Toys & Games    Amazo…  Welcom…  Twitte…  …                                   +   Australis says "screw that, everyone has three tabs open on a widescreen display", and shows you this:    _____________________________________________________   ° ° ° + v <|Amazo…  Welcom…  Twitte…  …            |>   Your current tab has no more text space than any other open tab, perhaps isn't even visible in the tab chooser, and almost certainly doesn't have enough space to show the page title.  Regressing aspects of this:  * The ability to contextualize the current page/tab is removed. Rapidly shifting between tabs with a keyboard shortcut never reveals the page title, which -- believe it or not -- is actually sometimes useful, and is certainly much quicker than having to read the page to find out what's going on.  * The ability to contextualize the current *window* is removed. There's now no title for a Firefox window! Instead I have a stream of bug numbers and fragments of letters near where a title normally is. My ability to Cmd-~ between windows, scanning the titles -- "oh, that's an l10n bug, this is my l10n bug window" -- has been totally removed.   In short: at the risk of sounding all ZOMG CHANGE, this seems like a useful affordance has been removed to save vertical space.  Can we allow this to be customized, so that I can save my vertical space with Vertical Tabs and buy myself a page title again?|2013-11-19T00:07:48Z

Identifying those tab's is the key in doing it. While there's `tab.linkedPanel` it feels wrong to depend on such an intimate implementation details that may change at some point. It would be great if we had a tab interface consistent with a Fennec's Tab: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Extensions/Mobile/API/Tab  For the very least `tab.id`.

I believe that this doesn't make sense, as the docshellID is an in-memory key referring to the (globally indexed, valid per session) docshell used on the system. When we restore sessionstore.js, we set the docshellID field of nsISHEntry to this now dangling value. For all we know, this may cause bugs.  Now, the only case in which I believe docshellID makes sense is if we are restoring without leaving Firefox, which is a rather unusual case. I suspect that we should get rid of this field.|2013-11-29T13:59:15Z

It worked fine until recently.   Actual results:  Since the last security update on Nov. 16th Mozilla Firefox scrambles the TV broadcast. Firefox repeats parts of the TV broadcast and does not show other parts. The TV broadcast (www.ndr.de) still works fine on other browsers like the Internet Explorer, therefore the problem is with Firefox.

I am still reluctant on this since it means a new nav.mozSocial api, but after talks with both boriss and madhava, the best, if not optimal, ux is to have the sidebar toggle button in the providers panel.  It's also the most consistent with other toolbar buttons that show sidebars (e.g. bookmark menu button).  - sidebar open/close will require user event - add nav.mozSocial.sidebar.open() and .close() - open will either return the window object, similar to window.open(), or via callback (similar to other mozSocial apis)|2013-12-11T00:58:25Z

Visit "http://jobboerse.arbeitsagentur.de/". Click "Erweiterte Suche", which brings you to the extended form "http://jobboerse.arbeitsagentur.de/vamJB/stellenangeboteFinden.html". Leave the form blank and click "Stellenangebote suchen" at the bottom, showing you a list on the next page. Click "Suche ändern" at the bottom which brings you to the extended form again.  Now the back button of Firefox doesn't work at that page.   Actual results:  When clicking the back button, the current site with the form is reloaded. It is not possible to go further back with a simple left click. The bold line in the back button history list, indicating the current page, doesn't change. If your back button history list, 15 last entries max, is filled up with with those "corrupted" entries, it is impossible to reach a previous site by right clicking the back button and selecting a previous corrupted entry, it just refreshes the current page. If your back button history list is not filled and you can reach a previous site directly the forward button doesn't work, reloading the current page instead of going forward, once you reach a corrupted entry.   Expected results:  The back button should always work. So when clicking it, it goes one page back, also in the back button history list, no matter what page you are visiting. The back/forward button history list should have small arrows at top and bottom like the bookmark list has, if there are more entries which aren't shown, so the "corrupted" entries can be skipped and any previous page can be reached directly. It doesn't make much sense to limit it to 15 entries and having to reload 3 pages just to reach the very first of the tab.|2013-12-11T08:43:24Z

Enable Flash Player, if not already. 2. Navigate to:  http://rawgithub.com/koganei/ZeroClipboardIssue/master/index.html 3. Click and hold on any of the divs.  (You will actually end up clicking on a transparent Flash object.) 4. Drag that Flash object over the other divs.   Actual results:  The UI of the div that the Flash object was hovering over at the time of your click will sometimes be hijacked by the transparent Flash object, so that it almost looks like the items are being reordered and/or having their text changed as you drag (they're not).

I have experimented with submitting searches to eBay such that they get redirected to HTTP. That seems to work, and it would send a nice message to eBay that we want searches to be done over HTTPS. As you can see from bug 771788, we're making great progress on making all the in-built functionality in Firefox use HTTPS by default, and this is likely to be a long pole.  Assigning to Kev for now since the first step seems to be a discussion with eBay about adding HTTPS support that doesn't just redirect to HTTP.|2014-01-12T01:12:18Z

962446|Firefox addon updates vulnerable to hijacking through AMO|All|Security|2014-01-22T07:26:15Z|||(Taken from http://s0beit.me/vulnerabilities/firefox-plugin-ownership-hijacking-exploit/)  Steps to repro: 1. Alice makes an addon and doesn't specify an update URL. She doesn't upload it to AMO. 2. Bob takes her addon, turns it into malware, then uploads it to AMO.  Result: All users who've installed Alice's addon automatically get the malware update from AMO.  I'm marking this as sec-major because, as the author of the original post points out, this could be disastrous if someone decides to find addons without update URLs on Github and upload them all with injected malware to the addons store. Granted, it's probably mitigated by AMO's addon review process. But I'd rather not trust that alone.|2014-01-22T07:26:15Z

969669|Display data type selection UI whenever meta/global indicates that another client could not offer one of our supported datatypes|All|Sync|2014-02-07T23:22:29Z|||Brief summary: Android Sync won't offer to sync your prefs etc. (because it can't), so if you set up Sync on your phone, your desktop will never sync add-ons or prefs.  Fix this -- and future extensions -- by re-offering to choose what to sync when this situation is detected.    From an old email:  ---- Here's the issue. Android syncs some stuff. Desktop syncs more: add-ons, prefs. (It only syncs these to other desktops.)  The Sync protocol was never designed to handle a growing set of engines. It has no built-in mechanism for adding to an existing set, or for clients to have different capabilities but still share datatype elections.  This is OK right now: only desktop can create Sync accounts. Android simply ignores the engines it doesn't know about when it syncs.  But now Android can create a new FxA+Sync account.  We have a number of options. *dons ideation hat*   1. Include prefs and add-ons in the Android datatype elections. This has the potential to be confusing, even if we call them out specially as only affecting desktop, but it's the least complex option. We are still screwed if we add an engine in the future (as we were when we added add-on sync).  2. Don't include prefs and add-ons. Anyone who sets up an account on Android won't be syncing prefs or add-ons. This is dodgy.  3. Include prefs and add-ons in the defaults, but don't show them in the UI. Users who don't want to be syncing prefs or add-ons between their desktops *will be*, without their knowledge.  4. Try to figure out a smarter thing to do in the protocol altogether, in the vein of "voting" with explicit capabilities. This is difficult, and I don't think in scope for 29 (or Sync 1.5 in general).  5. Do a limited, smarter thing on desktop clients, the beginnings of 'growth handling': 1. If this is the first meta/global we've seen, and 2. It omits engines we know about ("addons" and "prefs"), then 3. Pop up a pre-filled datatype election dialog, just as if you asked to do so during setup, or prompt them to take a look in settings to turn some stuff on.  6. Some combination of #5 and #3.  7. #6 but better: try to figure out a dumb thing we can do in the protocol, whereby meta/global entries are tri-state: on, off, unknown. Do option #5, but smarter.  ----    ibarlow's opinion:   ---- - not show users stuff that isn’t of use on that particular platform. In other words, don’t show desktop sync options on Android.  - For the small subset of users who opt to customize their sync options on their android device first, and then sign in on their desktop browser second, show the datatype elections UI on both platforms. First on Android with the basic options (bookmarks / passwords / history / tabs), and then again on Desktop with the additional Prefs / Add-ons options in the list.  ----    Bending this a little bit to address our goals, the conclusion is somewhere between #5 and #7 in my original email -- either *guess* that if "prefs" and "addons" are missing from meta/global, we should show a dialog, or *explicitly* track "declined" engines in meta/global. The latter requires client support and a spec bump.  Because this involves a spec bump, we should do it before 29 reaches Beta.|2014-02-07T23:22:29Z

Web Page, complete' fails due to overlong path, no active notification after first download|All|Downloads Panel|2014-02-14T04:55:06Z|||User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:27.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/27.0 (Beta/Release) Build ID: 20140127194636  Steps to reproduce:  Create a local file path that is close to the limit for the filesystem (only tested so far on NTFS on Windows XP and 7).  Load a web page in Firefox, then do 'File... Save Page As... Web Page, complete' on a page where the /.../PAGENAME_files directory is not too long a path for the filesystem, but one or more of the /.../PAGENAME_files/CONSTITUENT files are too long a path for the filesystem.   Actual results:  If this is the first download for a fresh profile, then when the download fails due to the overlong path for one of the page constituent files, a "caption box" pointing at the downloads button will actively report the failure to save / download.  That first download sets browser.download.panel.shown = true.  If you then repeat that Save Page As that will fail due to the overlong path (or save another page that that's the case for), there is no active notification of the failed download, requiring the user to always poll the downloads button after every page save to see whether it actually worked or not.  Manually resetting browser.download.panel.shown in about:config and retrying causes the active notification of failed download to come back.   Expected results:  The user should _always_ be actively notified of failed downloads with some sort of caption box, popup, animation, or button state change -- if downloads silently fail, the user is very likely to be unaware of this until it is too late.  I was unable to replicate this issue using right-click... Save Link As on other types of files.  It seems that that type of download uses chdir() or equiv. to evade filesystem pathname limits, while 'Save Page As... Web Page, complete' feeds overlong pathnames to the OS.  However, I was not able to test other types of download failures besides overlong paths, so it's possible this is a more general issue than saving web pages and other types of failed downloads after the first one for the profile are not actively reported to the user.|2014-02-14T04:55:06Z

I was writing text on a page, and suddenly the page was gone, Firefox was opening other pages, dialog boxes came…  What happens ?!  Is Firefox closing tabs and windows ?!  This is panicking.  After calming things down, I (sort of) understand what happened.   When I have the Option key pressed and my fingers happen to go down or up or left or right — which is quite easy ! —, Firefox goes back and forth in the tab's navigation history. Furthermore, the “sense” of the navigation is the opposite of common sense.  This is annoying. Leaving the current page must not happen against the user's will, it can easily mean data loss.  I have never enabled such thing. As far as I know, this is undocumented.  I don't think this comes from Mavericks. Safari does not do this. So I think this problem comes from Firefox.  Can you please remove this annoyance ? If not, can you please at least provide a way to disable it ?  Thank you.  Nicolas|2014-02-16T22:46:04Z

On version 25 of Firefox, when a download stops I could restart the download , pause , rename the file and resume from already downloaded size. Since the update 26 , the resume feature  works on both rar and avi files but not on MKV files. So, let me explain what I mean: before when a download is interrupted,  in the download directory, I have two fwo files ( name- file.mkv with 0 bytes and another name - file.mkv.part with X bytes downloaded). Since the updated 26 as long as the download is in progress, I have both files, but the moment I pause the download, the file with 0 bytes disappears dispear in the directory . And when I try to rename the previous doawnload with part extension so the name matches the name of download in progress, and restart the download I receive an error message like Firefox could not save the file and it overwrites the interrupted file. That would be great if you could fix this problem , because some downloads amount to dozens of gigabytes and to resume each download from the start is annoying and especially time-consuming. Thank you for take this into account.   Actual results:  File overwritten and deleted    Expected results:  With Firefox 25 I tried the same websites, the same procedures, the download resumes from where it is interrupted.

981429|In many windows, session restore fails to restore the active tab, and Firefox cannot reach its address at all|All|Session Restore|2014-03-09T20:08:13Z|||Hello.  Yet another session restore crappy bug.  Firefox 27.0.1 Mac.  At opening my Mac session, I have Firefox restore my session.  I cut the AirPort (wi-fi) connection.   In half of my 10 windows, I end up with the active tab being blank. Tab empty, titled “New tab”. Address bar empty. Even when I click in the address bar, I find no way to get back the address. The navigation buttons Back and Forward are greyed. The tab is not loading. It is not throbbing.   I put the AirPort back on. This does not help. The active tabs which are blank remain blank. I turn AirPort back off.  Pretty scary.  Some people give up at this point — and this means data loss.  BUT I request an address : www.perdu.com  Firefox gives me the error screen instead of the page — which is what I expect, the connection is cut. BUT, now, the Back button has come back to life. The Back button is now black, and when I long-click it I see the 10 pages of navigation history of my tab !  With the Back button, I go back.  And now I have the expected error screen.  Thank you for fixing this.  Nicolas|2014-03-09T20:08:13Z

986942|Top five pixel-rows of inactive tabs are not registering mousehover and clicks|x86_64|Theme|2014-03-23T16:26:05Z|||Created attachment 8395415 australis_tabs_drag_200percent.png  Considering Firefox is exposing the toggle to enable the titlebar in "Customization" in Australis, turning inactive tabs into magical buttons which don't register the mousehover in the top five pixel-rows is counter-intuitive.  It's made even worse by   a.) pre-Australis-tabs registering mousehover over their whole area, b.) enabling the mousehover when the titlebar is enabled or when the window is maximized, thus changing behavior, and c.) the open-new-tab-button still having the old behavior of registering the mousehover over its whole vertical size, although it's being displayed like an inactive tab.  The additional click-and-drag-area is just five pixels high, which adds up to only 21 pixel-rows for click-and-dragging the window.  On the other hand, enabling the titlebar to accomplish the same adds 32 pixel rows. This should be the prefered way of enlarging the click-and-drag-area, and not turning some tabs into magical buttons.|2014-03-23T16:26:05Z

I have version 11.2 r202 of the Flash player installed.   Actual results:  Firefox presented me with the Opening (filename) dialog box that asks whether I want to Open the file in an external viewer or Save the file to my Downloads directory, as if I had accessed a file type Firefox doesn't know how to handle.  Disabling all of my Extensions had no effect on this misbehaviour.   Expected results:  Firefox should have activated the Flash plugin to play the SWF file, in the same way that it does when I access an SWF file via an http or https URL, and in the same way that the Debian wheezy (stable) build of Iceweasel does.|2014-04-10T23:46:16Z

(I think I kept thinking I'd find better steps to reproduce or a reliable regression range.  I just came up with better steps to reproduce, but I haven't yet bothered with the regression range.)  But I see it in my real browsing at least a few times a week, and it's mildly annoying.  Steps to reproduce (real world):  1. have a Firefox session with a lot of tabs open, some of which are running a bit of javascript and which thus sometimes pauses  2. open a new tab  3. type something in the URL bar that involves a bookmark keyword, hit enter, and *immediately* press Ctrl+T to open a new tab  Actual results: the thing typed in the URL bar frequently opens in the new tab instead of the old one  Expected results: it should open in the tab whose URL bar it was typed in  Steps to reproduce (simulated, starting from a clean firefox profile):  1. bookmark this page  2. edit the bookmark to replace the name with "bug", replace the bug number in the URL with %s, and add the keyword "bug"  3. load the attached load simulator in a tab  4. open a new tab with Ctrl+T  5. wait for this new tab to fully load an the caret to appear in the location bar [if you don't do this, the symptoms are different but also buggy!]  6. type "bug 4000" and quickly press Enter and then Ctrl+T (the Enter and Ctrl+T have to be within the same tick of the 2s timer in the load simulator)  Actual results: bug 4000 is loaded in the new (current) tab  Expected results: bug 4000 is loaded in the previously-current tab, and the current tab is blank  I'm seeing this in a 64-bit Linux debug build, and have been for (very) approximately six months.|2014-04-23T20:02:57Z

WindowsPreviewPerTab is handling every MozAfterPaint event, which seems like a thing that we should *never* be doing to begin with.  It seems to update the dirty region and invalidate the taskbar preview window, which presumably causes it to get redrawn (thus triggering a canvas drawWindow).  Or that draw isn't happening, but just a bunch of time is spent doing the invalidation/calling into the dwm on every paint.  This seems bad, because these previews are rarely visible.  We should only be doing any of this work if they are visible (user hovers over taskbar button; alt+tab view etc) -- including installing the MozAfterPaint handler at the time and removing it when it's no longer active.|2014-04-24T15:49:42Z

Actual results:  Several duplicated and old bookmarks. I had to waste time manually removing them to avoid their propagation to my other devices. This is a problem I experience for a long time, so not related with recent version.   Expected results:  Sync should have detected that the bookmarks have been moved between folders.

1004055|Users don't know where the doorhanger went|x86|Device Permissions|2014-04-30T19:13:21Z|[fxprivacy]||We've gotten a number of requests where the usability problem is the same:   1) A page needs to use the camera/mic, e.g. User receives a call.  2) User does something that unintentionally causes the permission doorhanger to disappear:     a. They temporarily leave the browser (adjust volume, position windows, gather notes)     b. They temporarily visit another tab (do stuff immediately before call? Never!)     c. They acci-click on page before it appears (like my uncle who double-clicks links)     d. They click somewhere on the page (now you've done it. Some people...)  3) User doesn't know what to do next - "Nothing is working".  The user waits for the web-app, and the web-app waits for the user --> UI deadlock.  I am pretty certain that the blocking usability problem here is that it is not clear at all where the doorhanger goes when it disappears. [1]  I am pretty certain, because last year, for about two months, I was one of those people who didn't get it. I didn't know that a hidden choice was still available to me, because I had not learned to look for it. I thought events had moved on, that it was too late for choices, so I didn't even know to look for it. The Firefox doorhangers didn't work like anything else I'd seen up until then, and I had no learned memory of it.  Now that I know how they work, I love our door-hangers!  So given a love-story of one, this seems easily rectified by teaching users how they work. E.g. the first (few) time(s?) any doorhanger disappears, show users where it goes:  [#]  |\_______________________________________  | We've minimized a dialog for you.      |  | It's here. Click icon to see it again! |  '----------------------------------------'  This problem seems general to all our doorhangers, not just gUM. Chances are, before I learned it, I never cared enough where the geo-location doorhanger went, which is my loss.  --- [1] For those who don't know: doorhangers can be resurrected by clicking on the button at the head of the URL bar that the doorhanger extruded from.|2014-04-30T19:13:21Z

1008710|Firefox' session restore fails to restore text area Description in Bugzilla|All|Session Restore|2014-05-11T13:59:07Z|||Firefox 29 on Mac OS X Mavericks. In Firefox, I have this address :  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=__default__&product=Firefox&short_desc=Apple-drag-and-drop%20from%20the%20History%20takes%20the%20wrong%20entry  In the text area Description, I enter my description text.  I quit Firefox.  I relaunch Firefox.  * Expected behaviour : *  Firefox restores my session. I have my page, with my entered description text.  * Actual behaviour : *  Firefox restores my session, but in my page the text area Description is empty. My entered description text is lost.  The bug occurs in case of clean quit of Firefox.  The bug occurs also in case of computer crash.  This is data loss.  This is a regression — in Firefox or in Bugzilla.  A few months ago, this scenario used to work neatly.   With a normal form such as this page https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Sandbox&action=edit the restoration of the text area works neatly.  Something may be wrong in the Bugzilla page, but I have not found what.  The good news is that my entered text does get saved in the file sessionstore.js.  Thank you for correcting that.

For a fuller test go through all Windows objects and change all font/background settings to white on black. To aid troubleshooting it can help to use unusual colours such as lime green text on a red background - such colours make it easier to see which colours have not been set in the user interface and which have defaulted to the OS colour settings.

1008863|Unnecessary hyphens in hamburger menu reduce readability in some locales|All|Menus|2014-05-12T10:11:28Z|||Created attachment 8420873 Screenshot of the hamburger menu in the es-ES locale  Some locales use hyphens in the "hamburger" menu labels in order to fit long words in a small space.  However, doing so unnecessarily reduces readability for short words.  In the attached example (for the Spanish locale), you can see how things like "Nueva ven- \n tana" or "Guardar pág- \n ina" got split, making them hard to read.  Instead, they could have been split where the words naturally end, like "Nueva \n ventana" or "Guardar \n página", using the hyphens only when strictly necessary, which in this case would be only for "Complemen- tos" and "Nueva venta- na privada" (although I'd personally prefer "Comple- mentos" and "Ventana privada").  This is, hyphens should only be used when a single word doesn't fit in a line or when using natural spaces would make the text span for 3 lines rather than 2.  (Also, it's "pá-gi-na", not "pág-in-a".)|2014-05-12T10:11:28Z

Still happened with safe mode.   When I hacked away at my prefs.js file, I ended up in a state where back/forward functionality became completely broken.  I'm attaching the reduced prefs.js file, which just contains 3 entries:  browser.uiCustomization.state  social.activeProviders  social.manifest.getpocket-com which I've left at their values from my normal browsing profile.

A link header in that page will contain the url to a json file on the directory (or perhaps we include the manifest in the page itself)  - firefox loads the json file, which contains a list of manifests, compares that against frecency, sends a dom event or port message to the page with the top 3 matches (that are not installed)  - since our initial list of share providers will be less than 20, this should be enough in the short term.  We can manage the json file to limit it to a shortlist of the most popular providers if the list grows large enough.|2014-05-22T00:39:29Z

Since only regions with overdraw/underdraw need double-buffering (to avoid flickering), we want to only double-buffer those regions.  The BasicLayerManager allocates a surface for each overdraw region.  We should also consider atlasing the overdraw regions instead of creating textures for each -- we can avoid texture sampler changes this way.  We could also reduce draw calls by batching the copy of the overdraw regions to the draw target that way.

1022233|Reload shows instead of go to|x86_64|Untriaged|2014-06-07T20:15:02Z|[DUPEME]||User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:29.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/29.0 (Beta/Release) Build ID: 20140428193813  Steps to reproduce:  Open new tab. The address bar shows "search or enter address". Type in the address of a server that doesn't respond. (NOTE: an invalid domain that gives the "Server not found" page doesn't have this problem.) I used last.fm, which didn't respond at the time.  I got impatient, so I wanted to try a new request (helps sometimes). So I cliked the stop (X) icon in the address bar. The address bar still shows last.fm and a reload icon. I cliked this reload icon.   Actual results:  I expected this icon to try to reload last.fm, but all it did was clearing my address bar.   Expected results:  Try again to load last.fm (the url in the address bar).  Clicking in the address bar first gives the expected behaviour where firefox tries to load the url again (the reload icons transforms into a go icon in this case).|2014-06-07T20:15:02Z
