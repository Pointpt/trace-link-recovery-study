Steps to reproduce:

Pressed the search keyboard shortcut ctrl + f to open the search bar


Actual results:

Nothing


Expected results:

Search bar should pop up.

Ctrl + t did work, and ctrl + f in that tab did work also.
Numpad slash (/) for quick search also does work in the tab were ctrl + f did not work.
This problem occurs approximately 1 out of 30 times.
