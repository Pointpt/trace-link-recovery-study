Build ID: 20180206200532

Steps to reproduce:

1) i just go on my youtube bookmarks app and clicking on youtube 
2) youtube page just appear, so i click again on a video 
3) nothing appear on the page i just see a blank page 


Actual results:

I think the problem is coming from the last version of Mozilla that i just install V 58.0.2 
because i was using the program before, without any kind of issue and after the upgrade such issue start to appear. Basicaly the problem is that i can't open a You tube video that i just click on it. 


Expected results:

it should appear a youtube page with a video on it.
