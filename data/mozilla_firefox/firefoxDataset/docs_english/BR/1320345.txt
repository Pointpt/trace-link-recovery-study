Build ID: 20161124073320

Steps to reproduce:

I was testing the features in firefox 51 beta version 3 during testday 20161125. When I encountered Indicator to device permission test case 2 and loaded the URL https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/getusermedia/gum/ in the instruction.


Actual results:

The web page loaded but the media content doesn't and it throws getUserMedia: NotFoundError.


Expected results:

The media content should have loaded instead of the error message
