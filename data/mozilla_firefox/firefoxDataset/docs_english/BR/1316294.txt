Bug Number: 1316294
Summary: Wrong square size in webgl2 demo
Platform: All
Component: Canvas: WebGL
Creation Time: 2016-11-09T13:26:36Z
Whiteboard: [gfx-noted]
QA Whiteboard:[qe-webgl2]
First Comment Text: [Affected versions]:
- latest Developer Edition 51.0a2
- latest Nightly 52.0a1

[Affected platforms]:
- Ubuntu 16.04 32bit/64bit

[Steps to reproduce]:
1. Start Firefox
2. Visit demo https://www.ibiblio.org/e-notes/webgl/gpu/bounce.htm
3. Click the Next button

[Expected result]:
- A 20x20px size square is displayed.

[Actual result]:
- 1x1 px size square is displayed.

[Regression range]:
- This is not a regression, it reproduces back to when webgl2 was enabled by default in Nightly (2016-04-25)

[Additional notes]:
- Here are two videos showing the behavior on Ubuntu and Windows:
Ubuntu: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/109148197/webgl2%20square%20size.mp4
Windows: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/109148197/webgl2%20square%20size%202.gif

I did not uploaded them directly here because of the format used by the video from Ubuntu, sometimes it does not play for everyone (ran into this in the past).
