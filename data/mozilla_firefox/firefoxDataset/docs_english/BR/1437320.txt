Steps to reproduce:

Firefox 58.0.2 and macOS 10.13.3 trying to watch this video on YouTube:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlyzo9ll9Vw

During playback in Firefox at 1080p60 I get a freeze at 0:34 and a freeze at 1:09. It plays back fine if I switch to 720p60.

In both Safari and Chrome it plays back fine also in 1080p60, so it's only Firefox that yields the freezing.

Tested in Windows 10 on the same hardware with no problem, so a macOS related issue.


Actual results:

Freezing/pauses during video playback.


Expected results:

No freeze or pause during video playback.
