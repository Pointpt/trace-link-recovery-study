Bug Number: 1294761
Summary: Reader Mode Narrate - insert pauses between paragraphs
Platform: All
Component: Reader Mode

Whiteboard: [reader-mode-narrate]
QA Whiteboard:
First Comment Text: The narrate works. However, when s/he gets to the end of a paragraph there is not enough pause between paragraphs which makes it hard to feel and hear where the story is. I suggest no more then another full second pause in between paragraph so it sounds more natural.
