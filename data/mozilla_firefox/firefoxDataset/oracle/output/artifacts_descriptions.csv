First Comment Text: The narrate works. However, when s/he gets to the end of a paragraph there is not enough pause between paragraphs which makes it hard to feel and hear where the story is. I suggest no more then another full second pause in between paragraph so it sounds more natural.

Summary: search suggestion drop-down disappears at inconvenient times

First Comment Text: User-Agent:       Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.1.7) Gecko/20091221 Firefox/3.5.7 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)

The search suggestion drop-down frequently disappears while I'm typing a phrase, even if the phrase I'm typing matches the top suggestion exactly.

Let's say I'm searching for ""search engines"". Having typed ""search e"", the top suggestion is already ""search engines"". I notice this, and want to pick this suggestion.

However, due to a mental delay my fingers are still typing, so I end up adding ""ng"", making the whole phrase ""search eng"". Most of the time this will work just fine, and the drop-down will still be there after I typed ""ng"".

Occasionally though, the drop-down will disappear - and not reappear again regardless of how long I wait (unless I type more text).

This is rather frustrating to the user because the drop-down disappears at the exact moment the user is about to actually use it.

Reproducible: Sometimes




I suspect that every time I type something a web request gets made, and if the results don't arrive quickly enough the box is removed.

Suggestion: if the results don't arrive, and a drop-down had previously been shown, leave the (stale) drop-down open (and try to get the results again?), because it's less annoying.

The fact that the box is being refreshed could be indicated somehow - e.g. the ""search"" icon to the right of the search box could be animated.

First Comment Text: Occasionally, I'll open a new tab, type a letter (to get to some bookmark), and be greeted with zero awesomebar suggestions.  Pressing <down> doesn't give me suggestions.  Closing and re-opening the new tab doesn't fix things either.

The CPU isn't spinning while the awesomebar isn't listing suggestions.

But if I go off and do something else in the browser and come back a few minutes later, the awesomebar starts working again.

Sorry for the vague STR.  This has been happening to me for at least a few weeks.
