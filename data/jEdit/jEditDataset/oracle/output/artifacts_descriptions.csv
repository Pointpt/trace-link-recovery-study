BR_4020_SRC|"Bug Number: 4020
Summary: XML with entity and xml schema produces error and breaks jEdit UI
Description: When I open XML file then jEdit writes NullPointerException on STDERR and UI stops refreshing properly.

Steps to reproduce:
1. extract files from testCase.tar.gz to one directory
2. start jEdit
3. open file apiEntities.xml
4. NullPointerException message is written on STDERR
5. put cursor to the last line of apiEntities.xml file
6. press Enter and keep it pressed for a while
7. line numbers in gutter bar stops updated properly after few seconds
8. release Enter key
9. press and keep Up key
10. line numbers in gutter bar are updated but only from to bottom to the current cursor position (so for example you can see that line 7 is followed by line 63)
11. Keep the Up key pressed untill it hits begin of document
12. You can see that document content is not displayed properly (some lines are missing)
13. You can see other anomalies. For example try to click to some docked panel and then click them again to be not displayed (part of plugin window remains visible)

You can see something similar to attached screenshot.

Description: If you specify a DTD in a HTML-file, the parser doesn't
care about it, that shouldn't be.
And if you want to handle XHTML-files, you have to
parse them with XML as parser, but then JavaScript
isn't syntax-highlighted."

Summary: Bracket matching not working on very large files with brackets very far apart
Description: The functionality for Bracket Matching does not work when the beginning and ending brackets are very far apart. This has occurred on very large files where a pair of brackets are very far apart. I do not know whether or not this is because the attempt to find the matching bracket just takes so long a time that it will never return as completed or whether or not there is some limit on the number of bytes/lines between matching brackets, but jedit should give some information of what is going on. It is very annoying to edit a very large file in jedit and get back no indication when Bracket Matching is supposed to be occurring. Along with Bracket Matching not happening the various various Bracket Matching functionality, most specifically Got to Matching Bracket, does not work in these same situations."
BR_3908_SRC|"Bug Number: 3908
Summary: Performance problem when matching brackets in long lines.
Description: Host System:
- jEdit 5.1.0
- Java 1.7.0_65
- Ubuntu 14.04

(This is a similar issue to https://sourceforge.net/p/jedit/bugs/3904/ , but I believe it can be easily fixed while being consistent with the functionality of the feature)

The editor becomes unresponsive when matching brackets on long lines.

It seems to be iterating over the entire line to find the opening bracket.

In earlier versions the edit became slow when it tried to perform bracket matching ""vertically"", iterating over previous lines until the opening bracket was found. As a result, a bound of 10000 lines for bracket matching was imposed.

However, this bound was not imposed for ""horizontal"" bracket matching, so we can see a slowdown when lines become arbitrarily large.

My suggestion would be to impose a bound for the numbers of characters in the current line, similar to the bound on the number of lines iterated.

I'm attaching a Java program that generates a file exposing this problem.

Regards,
 Oswaldo.

Summary: file browser allows opening file in dir box as dir
Description: may be related to another bug I authored with yellow square in file tab.
1. start jedit
2. ctrl-o
2. put in full filepath into path box, click open
3. filename will show as ""yellow tab"" (white tab with yellow box in it), empty file (where there should be something), and filname showing with \ on end strangely enough, or the path shown has this the wrong way, or both.
4. close file.
5. open file by browsing and clicking
4. 2nd attempt to do it wrong on same file will fail.
5. 3rd attempt to do it wrong on different file will fail.

it only seems to happen when jedit is started."
BR_4005_SRC|"Bug Number: 4005
Summary: Odd change of help viewer font after change of text area font
Description: This is jEdit trunk 24461 with jdk-8u92 on Linux.

With Nimbus or GTK+ L&F the following odd behaviour can be seen in the help viewer. Starting situation: help viewer font 36px and main text area font 36px. Now open the help viewer. Keep it open while changing the main text area font to 24px: the help viewer font is somehow reset as well.

Closing help and re-opening it gets back to the 36px help viewer font.

Nothing like that happens for Metal L&F."
