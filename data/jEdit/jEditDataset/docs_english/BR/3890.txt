Bug Number: 3890
Summary: HTML/XHTML DTD and JavaScript-Syntaxhighlighting
Description: If you specify a DTD in a HTML-file, the parser doesn't
care about it, that shouldn't be.
And if you want to handle XHTML-files, you have to
parse them with XML as parser, but then JavaScript
isn't syntax-highlighted.
