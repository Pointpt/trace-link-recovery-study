Summary: Bracket matching not working on very large files with brackets very far apart
Description: The functionality for Bracket Matching does not work when the beginning and ending brackets are very far apart. This has occurred on very large files where a pair of brackets are very far apart. I do not know whether or not this is because the attempt to find the matching bracket just takes so long a time that it will never return as completed or whether or not there is some limit on the number of bytes/lines between matching brackets, but jedit should give some information of what is going on. It is very annoying to edit a very large file in jedit and get back no indication when Bracket Matching is supposed to be occurring. Along with Bracket Matching not happening the various various Bracket Matching functionality, most specifically Got to Matching Bracket, does not work in these same situations.
