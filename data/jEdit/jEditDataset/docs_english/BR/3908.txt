Bug Number: 3908
Summary: Performance problem when matching brackets in long lines.
Description: Host System:
- jEdit 5.1.0
- Java 1.7.0_65
- Ubuntu 14.04

(This is a similar issue to https://sourceforge.net/p/jedit/bugs/3904/ , but I believe it can be easily fixed while being consistent with the functionality of the feature)

The editor becomes unresponsive when matching brackets on long lines.

It seems to be iterating over the entire line to find the opening bracket.

In earlier versions the edit became slow when it tried to perform bracket matching "vertically", iterating over previous lines until the opening bracket was found. As a result, a bound of 10000 lines for bracket matching was imposed.

However, this bound was not imposed for "horizontal" bracket matching, so we can see a slowdown when lines become arbitrarily large.

My suggestion would be to impose a bound for the numbers of characters in the current line, similar to the bound on the number of lines iterated.

I'm attaching a Java program that generates a file exposing this problem.

 Oswaldo.
