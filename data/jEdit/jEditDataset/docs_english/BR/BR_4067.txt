Summary: Erroneous Dialog - Opening Backup File
Description: jEdit 5.5.0 under JAVA SE 1.8.0_171 under Windows 10 Pro
Every file I open now pops up the "Opening Backup File" dialog saying "the file ... is likely a jEdit backup file".  This never happened before v5.5.0. What is the criteria for determining when this dialog should appear?
